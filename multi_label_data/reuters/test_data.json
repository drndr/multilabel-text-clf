[{"id": "test/14826", "text": "ASIAN EXPORTERS FEAR DAMAGE FROM U.S.-JAPAN RIFT Mounting trade friction between the U.S. And Japan has raised fears among many of Asia's exporting nations that the row could inflict far-reaching economic damage, businessmen and officials said. They told Reuter correspondents in Asian capitals a U.S. Move against Japan might boost protectionist sentiment in the U.S. And lead to curbs on American imports of their products. But some exporters said that while the conflict would hurt them in the long-run, in the short-term Tokyo's loss might be their gain. The U.S. Has said it will impose 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on imports of Japanese electronics goods on April 17, in retaliation for Japan's alleged failure to stick to a pact not to sell semiconductors on world markets at below cost. Unofficial Japanese estimates put the impact of the tariffs at 10 billion dlrs and spokesmen for major electronics firms said they would virtually halt exports of products hit by the new taxes. \"We wouldn't be able to do business,\" said a spokesman for leading Japanese electronics firm Matsushita Electric Industrial Co Ltd &lt;MC.T>. \"If the tariffs remain in place for any length of time beyond a few months it will mean the complete erosion of exports (of goods subject to tariffs) to the U.S.,\" said Tom Murtha, a stock analyst at the Tokyo office of broker &lt;James Capel and Co>. In Taiwan, businessmen and officials are also worried. \"We are aware of the seriousness of the U.S. Threat against Japan because it serves as a warning to us,\" said a senior Taiwanese trade official who asked not to be named. Taiwan had a trade trade surplus of 15.6 billion dlrs last year, 95 pct of it with the U.S. The surplus helped swell Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves to 53 billion dlrs, among the world's largest. \"We must quickly open our markets, remove trade barriers and cut import tariffs to allow imports of U.S. Products, if we want to defuse problems from possible U.S. Retaliation,\" said Paul Sheen, chairman of textile exporters &lt;Taiwan Safe Group>. A senior official of South Korea's trade promotion association said the trade dispute between the U.S. And Japan might also lead to pressure on South Korea, whose chief exports are similar to those of Japan. Last year South Korea had a trade surplus of 7.1 billion dlrs with the U.S., Up from 4.9 billion dlrs in 1985. In Malaysia, trade officers and businessmen said tough curbs against Japan might allow hard-hit producers of semiconductors in third countries to expand their sales to the U.S. In Hong Kong, where newspapers have alleged Japan has been selling below-cost semiconductors, some electronics manufacturers share that view. But other businessmen said such a short-term commercial advantage would be outweighed by further U.S. Pressure to block imports. \"That is a very short-term view,\" said Lawrence Mills, director-general of the Federation of Hong Kong Industry. \"If the whole purpose is to prevent imports, one day it will be extended to other sources. Much more serious for Hong Kong is the disadvantage of action restraining trade,\" he said. The U.S. Last year was Hong Kong's biggest export market, accounting for over 30 pct of domestically produced exports. The Australian government is awaiting the outcome of trade talks between the U.S. And Japan with interest and concern, Industry Minister John Button said in Canberra last Friday. \"This kind of deterioration in trade relations between two countries which are major trading partners of ours is a very serious matter,\" Button said. He said Australia's concerns centred on coal and beef, Australia's two largest exports to Japan and also significant U.S. Exports to that country. Meanwhile U.S.-Japanese diplomatic manoeuvres to solve the trade stand-off continue. Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party yesterday outlined a package of economic measures to boost the Japanese economy. The measures proposed include a large supplementary budget and record public works spending in the first half of the financial year. They also call for stepped-up spending as an emergency measure to stimulate the economy despite Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's avowed fiscal reform program.

Trading in either crude palm oil (CPO) or refined palm oil may also be introduced. But he said the question was still being considered by Trade Minister Rachmat Saleh and no decision on when to go ahead had been made. The fledgling exchange currently trades coffee and rubber physicals on an open outcry system four days a week. \"Several factors make us move cautiously,\" Nainggolan said. \"We want to move slowly and safely so that we do not make a mistake and undermine confidence in the exchange.\" Physical rubber trading was launched in 1985, with coffee added in January 1986. Rubber contracts are traded FOB, up to five months forward. Robusta coffee grades four and five are traded for prompt delivery and up to five months forward, exchange officials said. The trade ministry and exchange board are considering the introduction of futures trading later for rubber, but one official said a feasibility study was needed first. No decisions are likely until after Indonesia's elections on April 23, traders said. Trade Minister Saleh said on Monday that Indonesia, as the world's second largest producer of natural rubber, should expand its rubber marketing effort and he hoped development of the exchange would help this. Nainggolan said that the exchange was trying to boost overseas interest by building up contacts with end-users.

Osaka-based Sumitomo, with desposits of around 23.9 trillion yen, merged with Heiwa Sogo, a small, struggling bank with an estimated 1.29 billion dlrs in unrecoverable loans, in October. But despite the link-up, Sumitomo President Koh Komatsu told Reuters he is confident his bank can quickly regain its position. \"We'll be back in position in first place within three years,\" Komatsu said in an interview. He said that while the merger will initially reduce Sumitomo's profitability and efficiency, it will vastly expand Sumitomo's branch network in the Tokyo metropolitan area where it has been relatively weak. But financial analysts are divided on whether and how quickly the gamble will pay off. Some said Sumitomo may have paid too much for Heiwa Sogo in view of the smaller bank's large debts. Others argue the merger was more cost effective than creating a comparable branch network from scratch. The analysts agreed the bank was aggressive. It has expanded overseas, entered the lucrative securities business and geared up for domestic competition, but they questioned the wisdom of some of those moves. \"They've made bold moves to put everything in place. Now it's largely out of their hands,\" said Kleinwort Benson Ltd financial analyst Simon Smithson. Among Sumitomo's problems are limits placed on its move to enter U.S. Securities business by taking a share in American investment bank Goldman, Sachs and Co. Sumitomo last August agreed to pay 500 mln dlrs for a 12.5 pct limited partnership in the bank, but for the time being at least, the Federal Reserve Board has forbidden them to exchange personnel, or increase the business they do with each other. \"The tie-up is widely looked on as a lame duck because the Fed was stricter than Sumitomo expected,\" said one analyst. But Komatsu said the move will pay off in time. \"U.S. Regulations will change in the near future and if so, we can do various things. We only have to wait two or three years, not until the 21st century,\" Komatsu said. Komatsu is also willing to be patient about possible routes into the securities business at home. Article 65 of the Securities and Exchange Act, Japan's version of the U.S. Glass-Steagall Act, separates commercial from investment banking. But the walls between the two are crumbling and Komatsu said he hopes further deregulation will create new opportunities. \"We need to find new business chances,\" Komatsu said. \"In some cases these will be securities related, in some cases trust bank related. That's the kind of deregulation we want.\" Until such changes occur, Sumitomo will focus on such domestic securities business as profitable government bond dealing and strengthening relations with Meiko Securities Co Ltd, in which it holds a five pct share, Komatsu said. He said Sumitomo is cautiously optimistic about entering the securities business here through its Swiss universal bank subsidiary, Banca del Gottardo. The Finance Ministry is expected to grant licences to securities subsidiaries of U.S. Commercial banks soon, following a similar decision for subsidiaries of European universal banks in which the parent holds a less than 50 pct. But Komatsu is reluctant to push hard for a similar decision on a Gottardo subsidiary. \"We don't want to make waves. We expect this will be allowed in two or three years,\" he said. Like other city banks, Sumitomo is also pushing to expand lending to individuals and small and medium businesses to replace disappearing demand from big business, he added. The analysts said Sumitomo will have to devote a lot of time to digesting its most recent initiatives, including the merger with ailing Heiwa Sogo. \"It's (Sumitomo) been bold in its strategies,\" said Kleinwort's Smithson. \"After that, it's a question of absorbing and juggling around.

Other countries are already cutting into the U.S. Market share here. Australia, the largest beef supplier to Japan, has been trying to boost exports prior to the expiry of a four-year beef accord next March 31.

High short-term interest rates, a bullish stock market and an increasingly stable currency reflect a massive inflow of fresh funds in the last two months, largely from Japanese and U.S. Investors, analysts polled by Reuters said. Fund managers want quality markets to park their cash in and have settled on Australia, Britain and Canada as they diversify from volatile U.S. Dollar instruments, they said. A one percentage point fall in key 10-year bonds rates in the past month, record share prices and a 10-month high for the currency of 0.71 U.S. Dlrs all illustrated the inflow. Official figures on the latest inflow of investment capital are not available, but brokers said they received almost daily inquiries from Japan and the United States. \"These people have got trillions of dollars sloshing about and they don't know what to do with it. Some of that is ending up here with the attraction of high interest rates and reasonable currency stability,\" National Australia Bank Ltd economist Brian Hamley said. \"There is a 'flight to quality',\" Hamley said. \"Australia may not be in the best (economic) position, but there aren't too many other countries where you'd want to put your money.\" The stronger Australian dollar was also attracting investors taking advantage of an appreciating currency against the volatility of the U.S. Unit, analysts said. \"We're looking a more favoured market than perhaps the U.S. Where some people would be concerned about the value of the U.S. Dollar,\" Lloyds Bank NZA Ltd chief economist Will Buttrose said. \"Why not put the money in Australia where entry is cheap and the currency looks stable?\" But turning that capital into more permanent productive investment depends on government economic policy, he said. \"It will only disappear if people lose confidence in the direction in the economy,\" Buttrose said, adding that offshore investors would carefully watch the government's promised tough economic statement on May 14. While happy to invest in bonds and other vehicles yielding interest unobtainable elsewhere, fund managers could just as easily reverse the flow -- particularly the Japanese, who were badly hurt in the past by rapid falls in the Australian dollar and hefty jumps in bond rates, analysts said. \"It will remain very edgy money. If something was not to be delivered, if the statement wasn't considered tough enough, one might see a substantial outflow,\" Buttrose said. Offshore investors are eager to see Australia take tough economic decisions to curb its 100 billion dlr foreign debt and stubborn current account deficit, analysts said. \"They are giving us the benefit of the doubt and I think they would like to leave the money here,\" Buttrose said. Reserve Bank policy has also reflected the increased interest in investment in Australia and the need to shield Japanese investors from rapid currency fluctuations. Reserve Governor Bob Johnston last week acknowledged an element of targeting the rate against the yen in currency policy when he said authorities could not take their \"eyes off the yen\" because of the crucial role of Japanese investors. Analysts said they believed the Reserve Bank had worked successfully in recent months to keep the Australian dollar within the range of 100 to 103 yen. Apart from its recovery against a weak U.S. Dollar, the Australian dollar has also risen almost three pct on a trade-weighted basis in the last three weeks. Offshore buying has also played a role in the booming Australian share market. It has followed Wall Street and other markets, but is also setting its own trend in response to the weight of both domestic and offshore funds pouring into equities, particularly in the gold sector. The key all ordinaries index rose to a record 1,758.3 today, nearly 20 pct above its level at the end of 1986, while the gold index has nearly doubled to a record 3,081.0 in the same period. The property sector is also sought after, with Japanese companies that have invested heavily in the United States in recent years turning their attention to undervalued real estate, particularly in the tourism field. Analysts pointed to the recent sale of Sydney's five-star Regent Hotel to Japanese interests for more than 145 mln dlrs as indicative of the type of property being sought. \"They think they find good value real estate here which, with long term and fixed capital investment, is the kind of investment Australia needs,\" Buttrose added.", "labels": ["interest", "money-fx"]}, {"id": "test/14891", "text": "ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - KUWAITI ECONOMY Kuwait's oil-reliant and debt-ridden economy has started to pull out of a nosedive but oil prices will determine the pace of recovery, bankers and economists say. Crucial will be the ability of the 13-member OPEC to hold oil prices around a new benchmark of 18 dlrs a barrel in the northern hemisphere summer when demand usually slackens. Bankers estimate the economy, measured in terms of gross domestic product (gdp), shrank 19 pct in real terms last year after contracting 8.1 pct the year before. This was after taking into account inflation in consumer prices of 1.5 pct in 1985, slowing to 1.0 pct in 1986. Factors depressing economic activity include the 6-1/2-year-old Iran-Iraq war on Kuwait's doorstep, which threatens the emirate's vital oil export lifeline through the Gulf and has sapped business confidence. But sentiment received a much-needed boost in September when, after a series of piecemeal steps to combat a debt crisis caused by the 1982 crash of local stock market, a comprehensive new debt settlement program was introduced. The share crash, result of a speculative spree in forward trading, left 95 billion dlrs of post-dated cheques in default. The cheques were also used as collateral for consumer spending, thus generating an informal credit system. Much of the debt has been watered down but big sums are still owed by individuals and companies. There was some 4.4 billion dinars (about 15.7 billion dlrs) in outstanding bank credit at the end of 1986, of which one-quarter to one-third was estimated by bankers to rank as bad or doubtful debt. But the government has repeatedly said it will not allow any banks to go under. The new debt settlement scheme entails a rescheduling of problem credit over 10 to 15 years, depending on whether debtors have regular cash flows or not. Banks' shareholders and depositors will have their rights guaranteed by the government -- an edict of vital significance in a country of only 1.7 mln people where the financial sector is the biggest after oil. Kuwait is better placed than any other OPEC country to ride out the oil glut, bankers and economists say. Kuwait has an OPEC quota of 948,000 barrels per day (bpd) compared with production capacity of 4.0 mln bpd mentioned last year by Oil Minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah. But strategic diversification into downstream operations in Europe several years ago and a hefty refining investment at home gives it guaranteed markets abroad and enables it to sell over one-half of its output as high-grade refined oil products. Oil industry sources say Kuwait is able to get an average 2.00 dlrs a barrel more by selling oil in the form of processed product such as gas oil, kerosene and naphtha, rather than as crude. Bankers say the rebound in oil prices is the major reason for cautious optimism. Other reasons are low domestic inflation, a bottoming out of the fall in imports in recent years and signs government spending on productive sectors will remain steady. External accounts are in good shape, with an estimated 1.8 billion dinar current account surplus in 1986, 16 pct below that for 1985, but still an achievement in the recession-hit Gulf. Kuwait's petrodollar reserves in mid-1986 were put officially at over 80 billion dlrs, earning investment income of the equivalent of about 3.65 billion dlrs a year. But for the first time since the end of the oil boom, these reserves may not be enough to prevent a \"real\" budget deficit for the 1986/87 fiscal year ending June 30, bankers say. In a budget portrayed by bankers as mildly contractionary, revenues for 1986/87 were cut 38.6 pct and spending 11 pct, doubling the nominal deficit to 1.33 billion dinars. This left out income from state reserves, usually excluded in official budget accounting, which are forecast by bankers at up to 1.0 billion dinars in 1986/87, resulting in some shortfall. Bankers say it is too early to venture a forecast for economic growth this year or next. \"It depends on oil prices,\" one said. \"This summer is important.\" Cabinet Affairs Minister Rashid al-Rashid said last Sunday the cabinet has ratified recommendations to rationalise state spending in favour of productive sectors and reactivate the economy.

The growers were asked for their reaction to an Oil World newsletter report that Malaysia's oil palm output is likely to drop sharply this year. Palm oil now sells at around 700 ringgit a tonne, or about 115 ringgit less than soybean oil, but Malaysia must sell more palm oil to prevent a stock buildup that could damage the industry, a leading grower told Reuters. The country's palm oil stocks now total some 500,000 tonnes against about 800,000 last March, the growers said. The growers expect palm oil prices to ease later this year due to pressure from South American and U.S. Soybean output. The current South American oilseed harvest, mainly soybean, is likely to be around 25.7 mln tonnes against the previous 21.7 mln tonne crop, they said.

A Manila court yesterday issued an injunction barring UCPB from selling the shares, which represent 31 pct of SMC's outstanding capital stock of 121 mln shares, until hearings on April 21 on a petition filed by Eduardo Cojuangco, a former chairman of both SMC and UCPB. Cojuangco said the Coconut Industry Investment Fund (CIIF) and 1.4 mln farmers were the rightful owners of the shares. Cojuangco said the shares were held in trust by UCPB and represented a blue chip investment. His petition said UCPB's plans to sell the shares to SMC were \"a serious breach of fiduciary duties.\" The SMC sources said the proposed share sale could also be held up by a second derivative suit filed before the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by Eduardo de los Angeles, a government nominee on the company's board. De los Angeles, who represents SMC's minority stockholders, asked the SEC to block the transaction, approved last week by the company's board. On April 2 the board sanctioned the repurchase of the sequestered shares for 4.79 billion pesos at 126 pesos per share. De los Angeles told the SEC the company's retained earnings of 1.33 billion pesos would be wiped out by the purchase of the shares and would prevent the declaration of dividends. De los Angeles said the share purchase would also violate an SMC agreement with its creditors to maintain a 2.2-to-1 debt to equity ratio. He quoted SMC's chief financial director Ramon del Rosario as telling the board that the transaction would boost the ratio to 2.5-to-1. In petitioning the SEC, de los Angeles amended an earlier suit two weeks ago in which he charged SMC Chairman Andres Soriano III and nine other directors of violating their duties. De los Angeles' earlier complaint related to SMC assuming last December a 26.5 mln dlr loan contracted by SMC's Hong Kong subsidiary &lt;Neptunia Corp> for a down payment on the shares. The loan assumption was again ratified by last week's board meeting. An arbitration panel set up by President Corazon Aquino to resolve the ownership issue is expected to submit its report by April 15. \"The amended suit filed by Eduardo de los Angeles is part of a continuing attempt by certain elements, in complete disregard of the facts and with questionable motives, to delay an early disposition of the sequestered shares,\" San Miguel Corp said in a statement. \"Coming as it does, when San Miguel Corp and UCPB have reached agreement on the price of the shares and the method of payment, this suit is in direct contravention of the government's expressed desire to reach an amicable settlement of the controversy by April 15,\" the statement added. A San Miguel spokesman said he had no comment on Cojuangco's court petition, adding: \"Any statement coming from us might be interpreted as adversarial.\" Meanwhile, Ramon Diaz, the head of a government panel which sequestered the shares last year, said Soriano was not eligible to buy the major portion of the shares because he was a United States citizen.

In a speech to the Institute of Contempory German Affairs here, Poehl said \"It would be an extremely risky policy to aim for a further substantial decline in the value of the dollar to correct the trade deficit.\" He said the United States could face a vicious circle of depreciation, inflation and more depreciation if it took that route. Poehl noted West Germany had already taken steps to meet U.S. Demands for greater stimulation of its domestic economy, accelerating tax cuts, cutting interest rates and tolerating above-target money supply growth. He said he would have been happy to have brought forward five billion marks of tax cuts now planned for January 1988 to the beginning of this year, but he said the government faced political constraints getting such measures through the upper house of the West German parliament. But there were also limits to the impact West Germany could accept on exports from a rising mark, he said. Poehl said West Germany relied on exports for about one-third of its gross national product, so a substantial erosion of export markets could not be offset by increasing demand at home. \"A further appreciation of the mark could even be an obstacle to further growth,\" he said. Poehl said the Bundesbank had tolerated rapid money supply growth last year because the country enjoyed low inflation and because external factors, including low oil prices and favourable terms of trade, had given some extra leeway. But Poehl said West Germany now faced a difficult dilemma over monetary policy. The underlying rate of inflation was now two pct, not the reported negative inflation rates last year, and West Germany was affected more than before by exchange rate developments. \"For the time being, we will have to focus our policy more on the external side, and we can live with a more expansionary money supply. But we must be very careful,\" he said. He said he shared some of the U.S. Concern about Japan's trade surpluses, which affected European countries as well as the United States. Poehl welcomed the so-called Louvre accord of monetary officials of major industrialized countries, saying the importance of the February 22 agreement to stabilize exchange rates had been underestimated. All partners had agreed that the dollar was at about the right level, and that further changes would damage growth, he said. \"This was a remarkable change in attitude, especially on the part of our American colleagues,\" he said.

Speaking to the National Association of Manufacturers, Proxmire said recent insider trading stock scandals increased the chance that Congress will act to curb abuses. \"We are proposing legislation that would provide for more disclosure, would be fairer to all shareholders, and would insure that takeovers are properly financed,\" he said. Among the provisions, the bill would reduce the threshold for notifying the Securities and Exchange Commission that a investor or group has acquired a percentage of stock in a company to three pct from the current five pct threshold within 10 days, Proxmire said. In addition, there would be a pre-notificaton requirement that an investor intended to aquire three pct that would have to filed with the SEC. Proxmire said the pre-notification requirement was meant to prevent arbitragers from having a jump on the general public in knowing about coming takeover attempts. Proxmire said he would call for extending the period that a tender offer must be kept open under the Williams Act to 60 business days from the current 20 business days. His bill would provide for private suits if the acquiring company violated the time period on the tender offer. To correct abuses in the financing of takeovers, Proxmire said the legislation would aim at insuring current margin requirments are properly enforced. The Federal Reserve Board has a 50 pct margin requirement for purchasing stock, but Proxmire said it is not generally enforced in hostile takeovers. Rather, the groups or individuals leading a takeover declare that they can raise the capital for a takeover without actually putting any of their own money, Proxmire said. He said his bill would allow private suits for damages for failure to meet the Federal Reserve's 50 pct margin requirements. The bill also would require more disclose when several investors form an alliance in a hostile takeover. \"When Pickens and Icahn get together we want people to know about it,\" Proxmire said. Proxmire said he favored the approach used in Britain towards two-tiered tender offers that insures that all shareholders recieve equal treatment. He said he expected amendments to the bill also would cover defensive mechanisms such as green mail and poison pills.

They said sunflower, maize and sorghum production estimates had been reduced despite some later warm, dry weather, which has allowed a return to harvesting in some areas. However, as showers fell intermittently after last weekend, producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense rain could cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season. Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27 millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province, 83 mm in Cordoba, 41 in Santa Fe, 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones, 95 in Corrientes, eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa. There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa. Producers feared continued damp conditions could produce rotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all the crops, including soybean. However, as the lands began drying later in the week harvesting advanced considerably, reaching between 36 and 40 pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower. Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvested material in Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yield estimates per hectare to be adjusted down again. The season's sunflowerseed production is now forecast at 2.1 mln to 2.3 mln tonnes, against 2.2 mln to 2.4 mln forecast last week and down 43.9 to 48.8 pct on the 1985/86 record of 4.1 mln. Area sown to sunflowers was two to 2.2 mln hectares, 29.9 to 36.3 pct below the record 3.14 mln hectares last season. Maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the area sown. It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and will begin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April. Production estimates for maize were down from last week at 9.5 mln to 9.8 mln tonnes, against 9.6 mln to 9.9 mln estimated previously. This is 22.2 to 23.4 pct below the 12.4 mln to 12.6 mln tonnes estimated by private sources for the 1985/86 crop and 21.9 to 25.8 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mln tonnes. Maize was sown on 3.58 mln to 3.78 mln hectares, two to seven pct down on last season's 3.85 mln. Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown in Cordoba, Santa Fe and Chaco. Harvest will start in La Pampa and Buenos Aires in mid-April. The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3 to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season. The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mln tonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week, and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last season's 4.1 mln to 4.2 mln tonne crop. The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted, remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5 pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for 1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of 7.1 mln. The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 mln to 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct up on the record 3.34 mln sown in 1985/86. The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in some areas and producers fear they may discover more damage. Some experimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areas making up only about one pct of the total crop but details on this were not available.

This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAF Corp &lt;GAF>, privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firms to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants. Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc &lt;ASH>, the Kentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping for money-making petrochemical businesses to buy. \"I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period,\" said Paul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co &lt;DOW>, adding, \"There's no major plant capacity being added around the world now. The whole game is bringing out new products and improving the old ones.\" Analysts say the chemical industry's biggest customers, automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of paints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year. U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about 90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hike product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher, managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demand for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up by as much as 300 pct, he said. Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in Houston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned last year and predicted it would have the best year in its history. In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S. dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. \"I believe the entire chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it,\" Oreffice said. GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemical industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987. Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion dlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985. The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and planning, said Pace's John Dosher. Dosher said last year's fall in oil prices made feedstocks dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar was weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boost U.S. chemical exports. Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers in the early 1980s. Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturers have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program to mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminate unrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry of friendly and hostile takeover attempts. GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire Union Carbide Corp &lt;UK>, recently offered three billion dlrs for Borg Warner Corp &lt;BOR>, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics and chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace &lt;GRA> has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions. But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as ethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that are custom-designed for a small group of buyers. \"Companies like DuPont &lt;DD> and Monsanto Co &lt;MTC> spent the past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had deteriorated,\" Dosher said. \"But I think they will eventually kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche market.\" Some top chemical executives share the concern. \"The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting carried away and repeating past mistakes,\" GAF's Heyman cautioned. \"The shift from commodity chemicals may be ill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long.\" Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by the Sterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700 mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend. Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyout of Dupont's Conoco Inc's chemical business, has spent 1.1 billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants along the Texas Gulf Coast. The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that are the building blocks of specialty products. \"This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a glamorous, high-margin business,\" Cain said, adding that demand is expected to grow by about three pct annually. Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, wood and steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical business could last as long as four or five years, provided the U.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth.", "labels": ["acq", "crude", "earn", "pet-chem"]}, {"id": "test/15065", "text": "FIDATA CORP &lt;FID> 4TH QTR LOSS Shr loss two cts vs profit 38 cts Net loss 90,000 vs profit 1,685,000 Revs 1,826,000 vs 29.3 mln Year Shr profit 3.37 dlrs vs profit 46 cts Net profit 15.0 mln vs profit 2,047,000 Revs 26.2 mln vs 123.6 mln NOTE: Net includes pretax securities sale gain 10,000 dlrs vs loss 1,000 dlrs in quarter and gain 486,000 dlrs vs loss 112,000 dlrs in year.

They said producers agreed that cutting sales would aid the buffer stock manager of a new international cocoa pact in his effort to support prices. Major cocoa producing and consuming nations agreed operation rules for the buffer stock at a meeting in London last month and the stock manager is expected to enter the market soon. Prices, under the weight of three successive cocoa surpluses, recently fell to the level at which the manager has to buy cocoa under stock rules. The buffer stock aims to keep prices within a pre-set range by buying when prices fall and selling when they rise. \"The world's cocoa price at present is just not interesting,\" commented one delegate representing a major CPA producer. Another source said that with much of the 1986/87 (October-September) world cocoa crop sold, limiting sales in the near term concerns essentially next year's harvest. The sources noted, however, that the cocoa industry in Brazil, the world's number two producer, is in private hands.

MORGAN &lt;JPM> NET HURT BY BRAZIL, TRADING J.P. Morgan and Co Inc said its first-quarter earnings fell by 3.2 pct, largely reflecting its previously announced decision to place on non-accrual status its 1.3 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term loans to Brazil. That decision, spurred by Brazil's suspension of interest payments on February 20, reduced the quarter's net income by 20 mln dlrs to 226.4 mln dlrs, compared with 233.9 mln in the first three months of 1986. Morgan also reported a loss of 1.8 mln dlrs from securities underwriting and trading, in contrast to a gain of 45.4 mln dlrs in the year-earlier period. In the fourth quarter of 1986, Morgan posted other trading losses of 5.5 mln dlrs because of setbacks in the trading and underwriting of Euromarket securities. Conditions in some sectors of the Euromarket remained difficult last quarter, with floating rate notes suffering heavy price falls, but a spokeswoman was unable to say whether Morgan's trading losses were restricted to the Euromarket. On the positive side, Morgan reduced its provision for loan losses to 35 mln dlrs from 70 mln a year earlier. Foreign exchange trading income rose to 82 mln dlrs from 72.6 mln and trust income increased to 95.9 mln dlrs from 75.9 mln. Morgan said other operating income, mainly fees and commissions, rose to 102.2 mln dlrs from 88.4 mln, but net investment securities gains dropped to 43.1 mln from 58.1 mln. Net interest earnings were 490.4 mln dlrs in the first quarter, down from 499.4 mln a year earlier, and net yield fell to 2.79 pct from 3.20 pct. If Brazil had not been placed on non-accrual, which means that interest can be recorded as income only when payments are actually received, net interest earnings would have been 525.9 mln dlrs and net yield 2.99 pct. If Brazil does not resume payments, 1987 net would be cut by 72 mln dlrs, Morgan added. After the provision for loan losses, Morgan's allowance for credit losses at the end of March totaled 953 mln dlrs compared with 910 mln at end-1986 and 815 mln a year earlier. It reported net recoveries of six mln dlrs after charge-offs of eight mln, compared with net charge-offs of 49 mln dlrs after recoveries of three mln a year earlier. Excluding Brazil, non-accruing loans at quarter's end were 583 mln dlrs, down from 633 mln at end-1986 and 684 mln a year earlier.

Ministry spokesman Leonardo Brito, speaking from Brasilia, told Reuters he believed that about five mln tonnes of this year's estimated crop of 65 mln tonnes would be lost. He said part of this would be the normal loss inevitable in harvesting, but that most of it would stem from storage problems. Brazil has a storage capacity of 66 mln tonnes, theoretically sufficient for the crop. But Brito said that the storage capacity was badly distributed. The states of Sao Paulo, Parana and Rio Grande do Sul had between them 70 pct of the nation's capacity, but were responsible for only 50 to 60 pct of production. The biggest problems are concentrated in the Centre-West growing regions, where rising production has outpaced storage capacity. Brito said the Centre-West, whose crops include soya and maize, had between 30 and 40 pct of the nation's grains production but only 20 pct of its storage space. In addition to the poor distribution of storage units, there is the problem that too much of the capacity is geared to storing grain in sacks, while not enough is suitable for storing loose grain, Brito said. Finally, there is a shortage of lorries to transport the crops. The sheer scale of the task in transporting the record crop has been evident from television reports, which have shown enormous queues of lorries waiting outside granaries.", "labels": ["corn", "grain", "oilseed", "soybean"]}, {"id": "test/15107", "text": "FLEET &lt;FLT> SHAREHOLDERS APPROVE SHARE INCREASE Fleet Financial Group said its shareholders approved an increase in shares of the company's authorized common stock to 100,000,000 shares from 75,000,000 shares currently.

The takeover spotlight fell today on Burlington, which rose 4-7/8 to 52-7/8 on speculation that investor Asher Edelman and Dominion Textiles Inc of Canada bought an almost five pct stake. A published report said Edelman and Dominion jointly acquired a stake in Burlington and were weighing a takeover offer. Edelman would not comment, and a spokesman for Montreal-based Dominion called the report just \"rumors.\" Burlington said it did not know if the report was true. Wall Street professionals said they were not convinced of the story or that Edelman and Dominion would be the victors if Burlington actually came into play. Arbitragers said past comments from Dominion, however, added credence to the speculation. Dominion has said that it was looking for a takeover in the U.S. Last year, Dominion unsuccessfully bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120 mln dlr line of credit to be used for a U.S. acquisition. A Dominion spokesman said Canada's largest textile producer has been negotiating with \"many\" U.S. textile companies, but would not say whether Burlington was among them. \"There have been acquisitions in this area. It's not unusual that someone could be looking at Burlington after the housecleaning they've done,\" said Eileen Gormley of Thomson McKinnon. Burlington sold its domestic operations, which made sheets and other linens, to J.P. Stevens and Co Inc for 110 mln dlrs last year. It also has reorganized management, and focused its operations on businesses that would be less affected by foreign competition, Gormley said. \"They've pulled back so as not to be a commodity marketer,\" said Gormley. She said in moving more heavily into industrial fabrics, Burlington bought C.H. Masland, which supplies carpets and other fabric to the auto industry. \"In the past, they just spent and never realized the return on the outlays they did make,\" she said. \"You look at their record over the year, and I think they're poised to be more profitable than they had been in the past,\" Gormley said. She estimated 1987 earnings of 2.50 dlrs per share, up from 2.01 dlrs per share. Some analysts today recommended clients not buy Burlington at its current levels. Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook said he recommends selling. He said he believes the stock is worth only about 50 dlrs on a takeover basis and about 46 dlrs on an earnings basis. Some arbitragers, however, said takeover values have been placed on the company of 60 to 65 dlrs per share. \"After Asher's (Edelman) recent history, a lot of people don't find him very credible anymore,\" said one arbitrager. Another, however, said Edelman succeeds in forcing managements to take steps to enhance shareholder values even if he doesn't win the target company.

Makoto Kuroda, vice minister of Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), is to hold two days of meetings with the Deputy U.S. Trade Representative, Michael Smith, and the Under Secretary of Commerce, Bruce Smart. The new tariffs, to go into effect on April 17, are in retaliation for Japan's failure to adhere to an agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at below cost and to open its home market to U.S. semiconductor shipments. They are to be imposed on goods which use semiconductors, including television and audio equipment and computers. Both U.S. and Japanese officials have said there was little likelihood the talks would do anything to avert the 100 pct duties on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese shipments. President Reagan announced the planned tariffs on March 27 after he said that close monitoring of the July 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor pact convinced U.S. officials that Japan was not honoring the agreement. In making the annoucement, Reagan said \"I am committed to the full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to provide American industry with free and fair trade.\" Trade analysts said his move was aimed as much at Japan's semiconductor trade practices, which are said to have injured the U.S. semiconductor industry, as Congress, which has complained about presidential timidity on trade issues. Congressional Democrats have pledged to enact aggressive trade laws to counter what they contend has been Reagan's inaction to redress the growing U.S. trade deficit, which last year reached 169.8 billion dlrs. About one-third of the deficit was with Japan. Reagan said there were recent signs Japan was beginning to adhere to the pact and that was why he was not terminating it. Kuroda said on leaving Tokyo today he had no new proposals but did have an explanation of the semiconductor situation. He told the daily newspaper Ashai Shimbun that Reagan's decision was based on inaccurate data and an exaggerated sense of MITI's power to control Japanese traders. \"The United States has excessive expectations.,\" he said. To stabilize supply-demand relations which have been disrupted by excess inventories since 1985 will take some time.\" He also said that U.S. firms had not been aggressive enough in trying to sell in the Japanese market.", "labels": ["trade"]}, {"id": "test/15156", "text": "HOECHST CELANESE SENDS REPORT ON NEW FACILITIES &lt;Hoechst Celanese Corp> said it sent propsective customers a confidential report describing its polyester textile fiber facilities in North Carolina and South Carolina.

Heineken last month reported a 1986 net profit of 285 mln guilders, after 265 mln in 1985. Chairman Freddie Heineken said the company, Europe's leading beer producer with six pct of market share in 1986, said sales increased by 6.3 pct to 42.1 mln hectoliters. The volume increase was due mainly to a rise in the U.S., Where the brand Amstel Lite saw great demand, and in Europe, where sales accounted for 25.5 pct of the total. Turnover, despite losses in guilder terms due to weaker foreign currencies, rose by 4.4 pct, to 6.7 billion guilders. Further consolidation of foreign companies, including the increase of its stake in leading Spanish brewery &lt;El Aguila S.A.> to 51.2 pct, new ventures and modernization, particularly in French and Spanish interests, eroded profit margins. The company still planned to invest 700 mln guilders this year in restructuring and marketing, Heineken said. Heineken's Spanish activities should start yielding profit next year, Heineken said, adding that its French operations had already turned to profit after vast rationalization last year. Vice Chairman Gerard van Schaik said the decision by the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg to allow foreign beer into the closed West German market -- Europe's biggest beer market -- offered interesting possibilities for Heineken. \"We have the beer, but distribution and sales is the important point,\" van Schaik said, adding that since the ruling Heineken had been inundated by German traders seeking joint ventures. \"The question is not if we want to penetrate the German market, but how we are to do it,\" van Schaik said, adding that while the widely traveled Germans seemed to be developing a taste for foreign beer, the internal structure was very regionalized. Heineken board member Hans Coebergh, responsible for African operations, said he saw Africa as one of the most important beer growth markets in the long term. He said the company, present in Africa since 1932 and with majority stakes in six breweries and interests in 25, was hampered by the lack of hard currencies there. Africa, where beer consumption averages only nine liters per head per year and sales are limited by import restrictions and currency risks, nonetheless accounted for 6.5 pct of total 1986 sales. On-site production is rendered expensive by the high price of imports of essential ingredients. But Heineken scientists have been looking at other possibilities. To balance the costs of imported malt, Heinken launched on the Nigerian market a new beer made of 50 pct sorghum, which had sold successfully, Coebergh said. Heineken is urging farmers to grow the traditional raw materials, but Coebergh noted that banana and palm beer were popular in Rwanda . \"This is a possibility, but we could not possibly achieve the Heineken flavor,\" Coebergh said. Chairman Heineken said the company's seven year efforts to penetrate the Soviet market had finally resulted this week in a contract that relaxed some of the restrictions they faced. But again, a lack of hard currencies limited Heineken's market potential. Heineken now has seven bars in Moscow that are enjoying good sales, but the bars only accept western money.", "labels": ["earn"]}, {"id": "test/15197", "text": "WALGREEN CO &lt;WAG> VOTES QUARTERLY DIVIDEND Qtly div 13-1/2 cts vs 12-1/2 cts prior qtr Pay 12 June Record 21 May", "labels": ["earn"]}, {"id": "test/15198", "text": "COLOMBIA BUSINESS ASKED TO DIVERSIFY FROM COFFEE A Colombia government trade official has urged the business community to aggressively diversify its activities and stop relying so heavily on coffee.

In March Ecuador said it would suspend interest payments for the rest of the year because of an earthquake which halted the export of oil, which accounts for about 75 pct the country's export revenues. In its announcement, Security Pacific said it will record interest income only as it is received in cash. The company also said it believes that Brazil will reach an agreement with its banks and that interest payments will resume later in 1987. The Brazilian negotiations resume on Friday in New York when Central Bank Governor Francisco Gros is expected to ask banks for a 90-day roll-over of some 9.5 billion dlrs of term debt that matures on April 15.", "labels": ["earn"]}, {"id": "test/15230", "text": "IRAQI TROOPS REPORTED PUSHING BACK IRANIANS Iraq said today its troops were pushing Iranian forces out of positions they had initially occupied when they launched a new offensive near the southern port of Basra early yesterday.

The pilots earlier this week offered to buy the airline for 2.3 billion dlrs, and assume 2.2 billion dlrs of existing debt. Takeover speculation has driven UAL's stock for several weeks. UAL last month said New York Real estate developer Donald Trump held a position in its stock, and that he also held discussions with its chairman. The developer indicated in those talks that he took the position as an investment, but he revealed no other plans. Today, rumors circulated that Coniston Partners were buying UAL stock. UAL jumped five to 70-3/4 on volume of more than 3.2 mln shares. \"United has got to consider this proposal. I think the pilot's proposal is realistic. I don't exptect them to take it, but it could put some interesting options in front of UAL management,\" said Timothy Pettee, Bear Stearns and co analyst. Analysts have said UAL made itself vulnerable to attack when it diversified away from its core airline. It added Hertz rental cars, Westin and Hilton International hotels in a strategy to become a travel service company. The strategy left its stock in a slump and its pilots union concerned that the company was not focussing enough attention on its airline. UAL has stood firm on its strategy. It is emphasizing its new focus by changing its name to Allegis, as of May one. But takeover speculation has escalated, and Wall Street has been busy calculating break up values well in excess of 100 dlrs per share. Traders today described the buying in UAL as widespread, indicative to them that big institutions believe the stock is in play. Market sources have said that although Trump attracted attention to the stock, the pilots proposal acted as a catalyst, kicking off a new round of speculation and perhaps throwing the company into the hands of another buyer. \"The first domino is you have an investor with a considerable stake. the second domino is the union.

A text was released in Washington. He said the effect of lower inflation and financial deregulation on monetary aggregates was now largely finished. \"Consequently, monetary growth may return to more modest levels,\" Heller said. He noted growth in the money supply slowed after mid-January. \"I would not be surprised at all if the monetary aggregates were to grow rather slowly during the balance of the year as well,\" he added. Heller said there was a danger of renewed price inflation. \"The pricing behavior of American producers in response to price increases of their foreign competitors will be crucial for our economic future,\" he said. Widespread domestic price rises in response to rising import prices would \"generalize the inflationary forces emanating from the foreign trade sector\" and might not gain more market share for U.S. producers. \"A return to the stagflation of the late 1970s may well be the result of such a behavior pattern,\" Heller warned. He said \"we at the Federal Reserve will have to be disciplined in our conduct of monetary policy.\" Heller said said the government should also exercise fiscal discipline and cut the deficit by spending restraint rather than new taxes. \"The imposition of new taxes would tend to rekindle inflation and certainly would not make us more competitive in international markets,\" Heller said. He said the U.S. economy should expand by nearly three pct during 1987, aided by higher exports to Europe and Canada.

Kenneth Morrison, staff associate at the Government Accountability Project, said inspectors consistently disclose violations of federal law, demonstrating a \"serious breakdown in the entire inspection system.\" Morrison told of chicken fat for flavoring being contaminated by \"intestines dragging in a water trough used to flush away the condemned product, fecal material, human spit, chewing gum and paper towels used by plant employees to blow their noses.\" Donald Houston, administrator of the U.S. Agriculture Department's Food Safety and Inspection Service, FSIS, defended the government's program, calling it \"one of the most respected public health programs in the world.\" FSIS inspects an estimated 127 mln head of cattle and 4.5 billion chicken and turkeys every year. Houston said inspection programs have kept pace with change, but conceded that the danger of chemical residues in the meat and poultry supply has increased. He also said that, although he was confident the bacterium salmonella eventually could be eradicated, it would take time and much money to contain the growing problem. Salmonella, which in extreme cases can cause death, is found in approximately 37 pct of U.S. broilers, 12 pct of raw pork and three to five pct of raw beef, Houston said. The number of reported cases has doubled over the past 20 years, he said, to 40,000 cases annually. \"We certainly really have not found an effective means of turning this disease around,\" said Rep. James Olin (D-Va.) The National Research Council recommended in 1985 that FSIS intensify efforts to develop rapid diagnostic procedures for detecting microoganisms.

The House of Representatives is expected to vote tomorrow to approve a trillion-dollar budget blueprint for the coming fiscal year that reduces the deficit by 38 billion dlrs. Similarly, the Senate Budget Committee has approved a plan that would cut federal red ink by about 37 billion dlrs next year. \"In terms of the economy, 37-38 billion dlrs is infinitesimal, so cuts of this magnitude will have little impact on the economy and the trade deficit,\" said Stanley Collander, a Touche Ross federal budget policy analyst. \"At best, it will have a small positive effect,\" Collander said in an interview. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker has repeatedly told Congress that cutting federal red ink would go a long way to help reduce the massive trade deficit and also help ease some of the downward pressure on the value of the dollar. The U.S. government has attempted to remedy the trade imbalance by driving down the value of the dollar. But Volcker has warned that a further fall in the dollar's value is fraught with danger. Such a decline, he has said, could refuel inflation as imported goods become more expensive and chase away foreign capital needed to finance the federal budget deficit. In addition, in February, U.S. officials meeting with other major industrialized nations in Paris agreed that the value of the dollar had dropped enough and that world exchange rates should be stabilized at around current levels. As part of that agreement, Japan and West Germany agreed to take steps to stimulate their economies and the United States agreed to cut its budget deficit. The alternative to driving down the dollar any further as a way to deal with the trade deficit, Volcker said recently, is to reduce U.S. consumption, particularly federal spending. \"If you don't deal with the budget deficit, everything else you do is going to be counterproductive,\" Volcker said in recent testimony before the Senate Banking Committee. Volcker also said he would prefer to further tighten the government's purse strings than have the Fed tighten the credit supply if action was needed to fight inflationary pressures or to assure the continued flow of foreign capital into the United States. Analysts say that Fed tightening now could choke off the current modest economic expansion and threaten a recession. Kemper Financial Services economist John Silvia stressed that any deficit reduction was better than none. But he said the size of the cuts under consideration were not enough to give the Federal Reserve Board the flexibility it needs to steer the economy or to keep the value of the dollar from plunging further in world exchange markets. \"There's no doubt that some deficit reduction helps, but if your objective is to stabilize the dollar and perserve the Fed's flexibility to conduct monetary policy, then the answer is, it's not enough,\" Silvia told Reuters. The U.S. trade deficit has become one of the government's most vexing and persistent problems. The 1986 deficit was 169.8 billion dlrs and there is as yet little indication that this year's figure will be any lower, though administration officials have predicted it will drop by about 20 to 30 billion dlrs by year's end. In the past, Volcker has joked that he never lost sleep worrying whether Congress would cut too much fat from the federal budget. On the other hand, he also has made it clear he is not attached to the gradually declining deficit ceilings set for the 1986-1991 period by last year's Gramm-Rudman balanced budget law. While the new law set a ceiling of 108 billion dlrs for next year's federal deficit, both the House and Senate Budget Committees have conceded that their budget plans would fall short of the deficit reduction goal by about 25 billion dlrs. \"For political reasons, 35 to 40 billion dlrs is about the most you're going to get\" out of Congress at the present time, said Touche Ross's Collander. \"To do something more than that would be extraordinary, remarkable and very, very difficult.\" Collander said the real danger for Congress was to end up short of the deficit reduction goal set by its Budget panels. \"To an extent, this has become the minimum acceptable reduction level,\" he explained. \"Anything less than that will now look like a failure to Wall Street.\" The budget plan now under debate on the House floor would lower an estimated 171 billion dlr deficit for the year beginning on October one to about 133 billion dlrs by cutting defense and domestic programs by 38 billion dlrs from their anticipated spending levels for next year.

They said they were looking for an acquisition. It doesn't surprise me that they came up with another one,\" said Allan Kaplan of Merrill Lynch and Co. American Brands failed late last year in its 2.9 billion dlrs bid for Chesebrough-Ponds Inc when Unilever N.V. agreed to buy the company. But since then, Wall Street has been speculating that American Brands would find another candidate to help reduce its earnings exposure to tobacco. \"This is just typical,\" said George Thompson of Prudential-Bache securities. \"There's going to be more to come here.

In a lecture at the University of Surrey, pre-released here, Koehler said that the only alternative to cooperation was protectionism and control on capital movements. \"Central banks have sufficient experience of exchange market transactions to steer exchange rates where they want to have them,\" he said. He added that West German growth forecasts would have to be revised downward because of the recent dollar drop to 1.80 marks from above two marks at the start of 1987. Koehler said that transactions on foreign exchange markets had parted company with transactions in goods, services and investments. It was the scale of speculative transactions that determined market trends. Speculative inflows could cause monetary aggregates to grow. To reverse such a rise in the money stock, interest rates would have to be lowered to allow funds to drain off. \"In other words, the monetary policy measures required are different from -- and sometimes diametrically opposed to -- those needed when the money stock is increasing as a result of mounting economic activity,\" Koehler said. The dollar fall was one means of reducing the massive U.S. Current account deficit. But attempts to keep the depreciation going by talking the dollar down posed problems. The sharp drop of the dollar had led to an immediate steep rise in the cost of U.S. Imports and a sharp fall in the cost of European imports. But the volume effect of falling imports to the U.S. And rising imports to Europe would take time to make itself felt compared with the price effect. \"Hence the depreciation of the dollar may well be going further than would be necessary to adjust the current account over the medium term,\" Koehler said. A reduction in the U.S. Current account deficit would occur only if the growth rate of GNP was higher than domestic demand. In Japan and West Germany by contrast, domestic demand should rise faster than GNP. \"In Germany this did indeed happen in 1986,\" Koehler said. If a further appreciation of the dollar was to be prevented, the U.S. Current account deficit could be offset by an inflow of foreign funds into the U.S.. But only if there was an appropriate interest rate differential would Europe and Japan look for financial investment in the U.S. When selecting monetary policy instruments, a central bank had to pay greater heed than in the past to the impact its measures might have on expectations and consequent decisions. Koehler said the Bundesbank was changing money market rates by operating on the open market rather than adjusting leading interest rates because of the signal this gives to the market and its substantial impact on exchange rates. It was not only important to achieve the domestic goals of price stability, economic growth and full employment but also to tackle international problems like the exchange rate problem, the debt problem and the current account problem. A strategy had to be designed that helped \"the safeguarding of non-inflationary economic growth in an international monetary system largely free of disruptions,\" Koehler said. Given the system of floating exchange rates, it was necessary for central banks to agree to intervene. It sufficed to tell the market where central banks saw exchange rates over the next few years and intervention points should not be set, because they were only testing points for the market, he said. In order to keep the international monetary system free of disruptions central banks should not only intervene jointly but also cooperate on interest rate policies, Koehler said.", "labels": ["interest", "money-fx"]}, {"id": "test/15365", "text": "AUSTRALIAN UNEMPLOYMENT RISES IN MARCH Australia's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose to 8.4 pct of the estimated workforce in March from 8.2 pct in February and 7.9 pct a year earlier, the Statistics Bureau said.

MPT, thrust into the spotlight by trade rows with the U.S. And Britain, is in a position of strength due to its control of a lucrative industry and its ties with important politicians, they said. \"The ministry is standing athwart the regulatory control of a key industrial sector, telecommunications and information,\" said one diplomatic source. \"They are a potent political force,\" the diplomatic source said. But MPT is finding domestic political prowess does not always help when it comes to trade friction diplomacy, analysts said. \"The ministry was a minor ministry and its people were not so internationalized,\" said Waseda University professor Mitsuru Uchida. \"Suddenly they're standing at the centre of the world community and in that sense, they're at a loss (as to) how to face the situation.\" Most recently the ministry has been embroiled in a row with London over efforts by Britain's Cable and Wireless Plc to keep a major stake in one of two consortia trying to compete in Japan's lucrative overseas telephone business. The ministry has favoured the merger of the two rival groups, arguing the market cannot support more than one competitor to Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd, which now monopolizes the business. It has also opposed a major management role in the planned merger for any non-Japanese overseas telecommunications firm on the grounds that no such international precedent exists. The ministry's stance has outraged both London, which has threatened to retaliate, and Washington, which says the merger plan is evidence of Japan's failure to honour pledges to open its telecommunications market. Washington is also angry over other ministry moves which it says have limited access for U.S. Firms to Japan's car telephone and satellite communications market. Much of MPT's new prominence stems from the growth of the sector it regulates. \"What has been happening is an important shift in the economy which makes the ministry a very important place,\" said James Abegglen, head of the consulting firm Asia Advisory Service Inc. A decision to open the telecommunications industry to competition under a new set of laws passed in 1985 has boosted rather than lessened MPT's authority, analysts said. \"With the legal framework eased, they became the de facto legal framework,\" said Bache Securities (Japan) analyst Darrell Whitten. Close links with the powerful political faction of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) nurtured by former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka are another key to MPT's influence, the analysts said. \"Other factions ignored MPT (in the 1970s), but the Tanaka faction was forward looking and ... Recognized the importance of MPT,\" Uchida said. Many former bureaucrats became members of the influential political group, he added. The ministry also has power in the financial sector due to the more than 100,000 billion yen worth of deposits in the Postal Savings System, analysts said. MPT has helped block Finance Ministry plans to deregulate interest rates on small deposits, a key element in financial liberalisation, since the change would remove the Postal Savings System's ability to offer slightly higher rates than banks, they said. Diplomatic sources, frustrated with what they see as MPT's obstructionist and protectionist posture, have characterized the ministry as feudal. Critics charge MPT with protecting its own turf, limiting competition and sheltering the former monopolies under its wing. Providing consumers with the best service at the lowest price takes a back seat to such considerations, they said. But many of the ministry's actions are not unlike those of its bureaucratic counterparts in much of the Western world including Britain, several analysts said. \"The United States is really the odd man out,\" Abegglen said. \"For a government to take the view that it wants to keep order in utilities markets is not an unusual and/or unreasonable view,\" he said.", "labels": ["acq", "trade"]}, {"id": "test/15375", "text": "G-7 ISSUES STATEMENT AFTER MEETING Following is the text of a statement by the Group of Seven -- the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada -- issued after a Washington meeting yesterday. 1.

Separately, West Berlin state central bank president Dieter Hiss told journalists that the discount rate could fall below its lowest ever point of 2.75 pct. He made clear that he was not making a forecast on interest rates, however. Currency dealers here and in the Far East said the dollar gained slight background support from the speculation.

It allocated 6.1 billion marks in new liquidity, much less than the 14.9 billion leaving the market as a prior pact expired.

The dollar opened lower against virtually all currencies and traded in a narrow range after the communique, which reaffirmed support for the Paris accord on currency stabilisation but contained no moves to strengthen it. Dealers in Frankfurt and Zurich saw the dollar remaining broadly entrenched in its current trading range. \"The dollar is likely to stay within a range of 1.80 to 1.84 marks,\" said Gisela Steinhaeuser, senior dealer at Chase Bank AG. She said there was some resistance to further climbs. However, she said the dollar could break out of the range with major surprises such as a worse-than-expected U.S. Merchandise trade deficit, due next Tuesday. Theodor Stadelmann, dealer with Bank Julius Baer and Co Ltd in Zurich, said he expects the dollar to hold steady against the mark and Swiss franc but to weaken further against the yen, possibly to 140 yen. A Milan banker shared Stadelmann's view, saying he expects a dollar-yen range of 140-150 in the short term. London traders said the G-7 communique failed to curb underlying bearishness toward the dollar but this negative sentiment was not yet strong enough to tempt interbank operators to test the downside. Concern that finance ministers and officials still in Washington could issue more concrete statements in favour of currency stabilisation kept players sidelined, along with worries about provoking fresh central bank intervention in the near term, the traders said. Most Paris dealers expressed disappointment at the communique, saying nothing has changed to reverse the dollar's downward trend. Traders in several centres said the market would look for fresh opportunities to test the willingness of central banks to defend current ranges, which the communique said were \"broadly consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting.\" Dave Jouhin, senior dealer at Midland Bank in London, said \"They're going to put somebody's resolve to the test soon.\" The U.S. February trade data may provide the trigger, dealers said. However, some dealers said London-based operators would be unlikely to open major positions next week ahead of the long Easter weekend. They saw near-term technical support at 1.825 marks and 145 yen and resistance about 1.83 marks and 146 yen. Chase Bank's Steinhaeuser and other Frankfurt dealers said the G-7 communique guaranteed a relatively calm and stable market for the foreseeable future compared with the extreme volatility seen in the first few months of this year. One dealer at a German bank said the wording of the communique made clear the leading nations did not want a further dollar drop, and this was supporting the dollar. The German dealer saw the dollar gradually appreciating to 1.87 marks, broadly seen as its upper limit within the Louvre accord's supposed currency target range. A Swiss bank economist said he believed the markets were ready for a period of \"mainly sideways movement.\" But Milan dealers were sceptical about the communique contributing to greater stability. \"Nothing has changed substantially to give the dollar a big boost,\" said one dealer, while another Italian banker said he expects the dollar to trade between 1.77 and 1.87 German marks in the next three months. A Swiss monetary source, who asked not to be named, said the communique had been in line with realistic expectations and should not have produced disappointment. \"The problem is that the changes needed in fiscal and trade policies to redress current imbalances are of a different timescale than currency markets operate on,\" the source told Reuters, \"This is a political process which takes time.\" Alois Schwietert, chief economist at Swiss Bank Corp in Basle, also questioned the tone of disappointment evident on currency markets today. \"Did people really expect a patent remedy?\" he asked. Bank economists in Paris noted yesterday's meeting was only the first in a series and said the market would watch carefully in the next few weeks for any changes in positions. A senior economist with Banque Indosuez said the focus was now on trade and growth rather than interest rates. Any move by Japan and West Germany to boost their economic growth could lead to a quick change in the U.S. Position.

Comments by Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler yesterday that rate cuts were needed to curb money supply growth from speculative capital inflows, and by West Berlin state central bank president Dieter Hiss that there was no natural lower limit to the discount rate had, however, no immediate impact. Call money declined to 3.65/75 pct from 3.75/85 pct but the drop was tied to extra liquidity in the market, dealers said. Dealers said the Bundesbank's latest liquidity allotment this week dashed some hopes of lower rates. The Bundesbank allotted only 6.1 billion marks yesterday in new liquidity in a repurchase pact at an unchanged rate of 3.80 pct, thus subtracting some 8.8 billion marks from the market, as an outgoing 14.9 billion pact expired. But some dealers said the smaller volume awarded by the pact was in line with present liquid money market conditions, and did not exlude a cut in the repurchase pact rate soon to 3.70 pct if money market rates continue at present levels. The next opportunity for the Bundesbank to lower rates on repurchase pacts will be in a tender expected next Tuesday. Bundesbank officials have already said they favour more discreet rate adjustments through repurchase pacts, rather than the more public adjustment of leading rates. The Bundesbank may either set a fixed allocation rate and allow banks to tender for the volume, as has been the case since it lowered its discount rate January 22, or else it may allow banks to tender for the rate and set the volume itself. Dealers expect volume of the tender to be lower than the 15.2 billion marks flowing out, to offset other incoming funds. Some seven billion marks is expected to flow in next week. This should then flow back into the market as it is deposited with banks. Banks were well supplied with liquidity, holding 61.5 billion marks in reserves at the Bundesbank on Tuesday.

Total revenue was eight pct lower in 1986 at 7.97 billion guilders vs 8.7 billion guilders in 1985. The company said its revenues were down due to lower foreign exchange rates and a change in accounting practice. It added that revenues would have risen by about seven pct had those changes not occurred. Revenue from Dutch operations rose five pct in 1986, mainly due to its life insurance business. Health insurance revenues in the Netherlands also rose despite a notable shift to insurances with lower premiums and higher personal risks. Damage insurances made losses, mainly due to car damage insurances. AEGON did not specify the loss. In the United States, revenue in guilders from health and life insurance was lower. AEGON said this was due to a change in accounting for U.S. Annuities. AEGON said annuities are subject to such strong personal investment influences that it should be accounted differently from the more traditional insurances. This change in accounting practice and another change to account for profits made on fixed interest investments, resulted in an incidental rise in net profits of 31 mln guilders. AEGON said incidental negative influences on net profits were slightly higher, being the lower dollar rate, high initial costs for new products, and the cost of new headquarters in The Hague. In 1986, a large number of new insurance products emerged in the Netherlands and the U.S., AEGON said. Large initial costs for these products have depressed net profits somewhat.

At a news conference after today's G-7 meeting, Miyazawa said the ministers and central bank governors did not believe a totally new statement was needed. The speculative selling did not reflect economic fundamentals, and since the fundamentals had not changed only a reaffirmation of the goals of the Paris accord was needed, he said. He also noted that this test of the G-7 nations resolve had concentrated on the yen, while other currencies, especially the mark, had remained stable.

The yen's movement in the past several weeks is within the range agreed in Paris in Febraury, he said. It was better to give a vague expression than pin-pointing a level, which could have an adverse impact on the market, Miyazawa said.

Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa fuelled speculation about the amount of fluctuation the authorities are prepared to tolerate by saying that the current yen level is still inside the range agreed on in Paris in late February. Official statements in recent weeks had indicated that the key psychological level of 150 yen was at the lower end of the authorities' permissible range. Dealers and analysts warned that the dollar's decline would probably be uneven. They anticipated a concerted effort to prop up the dollar and restrain the yen via a mixture of open market intervention and public comments. Shortly after the Tokyo market opened today the Bank of Japan was detected by local dealers buying moderate amounts of dollars. The dollar rebounded to about 145.20 yen.

The dollar opened lower against virtually all currencies and traded in a narrow range after the communique, which reaffirmed support for the Paris accord on currency stabilisation but contained no moves to strengthen it. Dealers in Frankfurt and Zurich saw the dollar remaining broadly entrenched in its current trading range. \"The dollar is likely to stay within a range of 1.80 to 1.84 marks,\" said Gisela Steinhaeuser, senior dealer at Chase Bank AG. She said there was some resistance to further climbs. However, she said the dollar could break out of the range with major surprises such as a worse-than-expected U.S. Merchandise trade deficit, due next Tuesday. Theodor Stadelmann, dealer with Bank Julius Baer and Co Ltd in Zurich, said he expects the dollar to hold steady against the mark and Swiss franc but to weaken further against the yen, possibly to 140 yen. A Milan banker shared Stadelmann's view, saying he expects a dollar-yen range of 140-150 in the short term. London traders said the G-7 communique failed to curb underlying bearishness toward the dollar but this negative sentiment was not yet strong enough to tempt interbank operators to test the downside. Concern that finance ministers and officials still in Washington could issue more concrete statements in favour of currency stabilisation kept players sidelined, along with worries about provoking fresh central bank intervention in the long term, the traders said. Most Paris dealers expressed disappointment at the communique, saying nothing has changed to reverse the dollar's downward trend. Traders in several centres said the market would look for fresh opportunities to test the willingness of central banks to defend current ranges, which the communique said were \"broadly consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting.\" Dave Jouhin, senior dealer at Midland Bank in London, said \"They're going to put somebody's resolve to the test soon.\" The U.S. February trade data may provide the trigger, dealers said. However, some dealers said London-based operators would be unlikely to open major positions next week ahead of the long Easter weekend. They saw near-term technical support at 1.825 marks and 145 yen and resistance about 1.83 marks and 146 yen. Chase Bank's Steinhaeuser and other Frankfurt dealers said the G-7 communique guaranteed a relatively calm and stable market for the foreseeable future compared with the extreme volatility seen in the first few months of this year. One dealer at a German bank said the wording of the communique made clear the leading nations did not want a further dollar drop, and this was supporting the dollar. The German dealer saw the dollar gradually appreciating to 1.87 marks, broadly seen as its upper limit within the Louvre accord's supposed currency target range. A Swiss bank economist said he believed the markets were ready for a period of \"mainly sideways movement.\" But Milan dealers were sceptical about the communique contributing to greater stability. \"Nothing has changed substantially to give the dollar a big boost,\" said one dealer, while another Italian banker said he expects the dollar to trade between 1.77 and 1.87 German marks in the next three months.", "labels": ["dlr", "money-fx"]}, {"id": "test/15462", "text": "WEST GERMAN BEET PLANTINGS DELAYED THREE WEEKS Unseasonal cold weather has delayed sugar beet plantings in West Germany by up to three weeks, the agriculture ministry said.

Monetary sources said they believed that U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker considered Tokyo's package, announced yesterday, to be a major stimulation of the Japanese economy. But yesterday's statement by seven leading industrial powers endorses the yen's rise from around 153 to the dollar, the level at the February 22 Paris Accord, to about 145 today. And the initial reaction of currency markets in the Far East demonstrates that financial markets are unconvinced that currencies yet reflect economic fundamentals, even though the countries appear to do so. The yen sank below 145 at one point despite intervention by the Bank of Japan. Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's Finance Minister, said the movement since Paris was consistent with currency trading ranges the nations agreed to defend in the February talks. \"I would say that what has happened (to the yen) in the past several weeks was not outside the range we agreed to in the discussions in Paris,\" Miyazawa said yesterday. The supplementary budget worth about 34.48 billion dlrs was announced by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party on the eve of Miyazawa's departure for Washington, to attend yesterday's meetings of leading industrial nations. In a strongly worded statement terming the Japanese action \"extraordinary and urgent\", the meeting reaffirmed the Paris Accord by noting that current exchange rates are within ranges broadly consistent with fundamentals, or economic reality. The Group of Seven -- the United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada -- therefore repeated their willingness to continue close cooperation to foster exchange rate stability. The cooperation agreement has resulted in concerted central bank intervention of 8 billion to 9 billion dlrs to halt the dollar's fall. While relatively unsuccessful, the scale of intervention between so many nations is unprecedented in recent years. Monetary sources also said they understood that Secretary Baker considered the meeting to be extremely successful in the light of the Japanese announcement. They also said there was a growing feeling among the finance ministers and central bankers that cooperation over medium-term policies has replaced the bickering over short-term differences in past meetings. West Germany, whose currency has not risen anything like the yen since the Paris Agreement, appears from the face of yesterday's statement to have won acceptance from other countries that its exchange rate is acceptable. Bonn's finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg argues that major currency shifts needed to remedy the huge imbalance between West Germany and Japan's trade surpluses and America's trade deficit have already taken place. No mention was made, however, of the U.S. commitment to cut the budget deficit even though it is implied in the reafffirmation of Paris. European nations and Japan believe deficit cuts are essential to curbing the record U.S. trade shortfall that reached nearly 170 billion dlrs last year. A similar argument was made on Capitol Hill earlier this week by Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker. A further sharp fall to redress trade imbalances would \"clearly pose substantial risks of renewed inflationary momentum and could undermine confidence in future financial stability,\" he said. Volcker warned a further dollar fall might force the politically independent Fed to drive up interest rates. Monetary sources said that, privately, West Germany welcomed the rise in the yen against the dollar while its own currency remained relatively stable against the U.S. unit. Bonn and other European nations worry that once the weak dollar blunts Tokyo's export drive to the United States, the Japanese monolith will concentrate on European markets. The ministers, meanwhile, also continued talks on making their policy coordination more binding and one, Canadian Finance Minister Michael Wilson, said good progress was made. Wilson said they will meet before the June Economic Summit to prepare a report for the leaders of the seven nations. The United States and France, backed by the International Monetary Fund, want the seven to agree on ranges or \"norms\" for a limited number of economic objectives such as growth, inflation, monetary conditions, trade balances and current account balances. Sharp deviations from these guidelines would result in consultations between the countries on whether corrective action should be required. But the inclusion of currencies as one of the objectives has Bonn and London worried, monetary sources say, because it implies Washington is moving in the direction of target zones. The sources said the Reagan administration unsuccessfully sounded out its allies on a system of target zones to limit currency fluctuations just before the February meeting. The concept is a much more rigid one than the secret ranges of the Paris Accord and would mark a sharp departure from the relatively free currency markets of recent years.", "labels": ["dlr", "yen"]}, {"id": "test/15550", "text": "BANK OF FRANCE LEAVES INTERVENTION RATE UNCHANGED The Bank of France said it left its intervention rate unchanged at 7-3/4 pct when it injected funds in the market against first category paper in today's money market intervention tender.

For finance ministers and central bankers attending this week's semi-annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, the new figures released by the IMF add an additional concern. The Fund estimated world output would only grow by 2.7 pct this year, versus 2.9 pct last year, and 3.1 pct in 1985. In the industrial countries, Gross National Product, a measure of all goods and services, was expected to decline to 2.3 pct this year, compared with 2.4 pct in 1986, the IMF said. For the developing countries, the Gross Domestic Product, another measure of economic growth, was expected to fall to 3.0 pct from 3.5 pct last year. The new figures are considered a major disappointment to the poorest countries. They had hoped that new vitality in the industrial countries brought on by a sharp decline in oil prices would assist their economic recovery and help them cope with growing mounds of debt. IMF officials, discussing their outlook, said they believed the industrial country economies would move up to an annual growth rate of three pct by the end of the decade. Economic analysts and the IMF have been saying for some time that the ability to keep the debt crisis from turning into an economic rout rests on sustained economic growth. Since the debtor countries must look to the wealthier states for markets for their products as well as financial assistance, economic weakness in the developed nations' economies poses fundamental worries. Debtor countries, including the very poorest states, have only a few avenues open to them for earning foreign exchange, including the key one of exports. The U.S. economy, which is in its fifth year of expansion, has served as a mainstay for developing country exports, but it too is seen as being rather feeble this year, growing by only 2.3 pct, according to the IMF. For this reason and because of a high trade deficit, the United States has been pressuring Japan and West Germany to ignite their economies but with little apparent success. The IMF study also examines the course of the dollar and the curious lack of impact it has had on the U.S. trade deficit. Reagan administration officials have been saying that the impact is now beginning to show up, although it has been much slower than expected. The IMF observed in its World Economic Outlook that \"it has to be recognized that exchange rate adjustments take time to work through to payments flows -- probably at least three years to get a resonably complete effect.\" The report added, however, \"the adjustments may take even more time on this occasion.\" REUTER^M", "labels": ["gnp"]}, {"id": "test/15552", "text": "SPANISH EMPLOYERS WORRIED BY HIGH INTEREST RATES The head of Spain's employers' federation, Jose Maria Cuevas, said employers were worried about the government's monetary policies because high real interest rates were hampering investment. He told a news conference wage pacts signed so far this year were not endangering the government's five pct inflation target. The government's perceived need to control inflation by keeping a tight rein on credit was unnecessary, he said. High real interest rates were attracting an influx of speculative foreign capital which was undercutting the government's target for monetary growth, Cuevas said. Spain's most closely-watched measure of money supply, liquid assets in public hands, grew at an annualised rate of 17 pct in March, against 11.4 pct in December last year and a target range of 6.5 to 9.5 pct for 1987. To combat this, the Bank of Spain has raised its call money rate 14 times so far this year, to 14.5 pct at present from 11.8 at end-1986. Cuevas said employers were heeding the government's call to hold wage increases to its five pct inflation target this year, with increases from salary reviews awarded last year and new wage pacts averaging 5.6 pct in the first quarter of 1987. These agreements covered less than 40 pct of Spanish workers, Cuevas said, with the rest still in wage negotiations. He said Spain's current wave of strikes mainly affected the state sector, where the government is trying to impose its five pct wage ceiling. Cuevas said employers were also worried about the trend in Spain's foreign trade balance. The trade deficit in the first two months of 1987 totalled 233 billion pesetas, a 68 pct increase over the corresponding period last year. However, employers did not favour a devaluation of the peseta to correct the imbalance.", "labels": ["interest", "money-supply", "trade"]}, {"id": "test/15553", "text": "SHOWBOAT &lt;SBO> DECLARES STOCK SPLIT Showboat Inc said its board declared a two-for-one stock split, payable to shareholders of record on May 15.", "labels": ["earn"]}, {"id": "test/15556", "text": "LEAD PRICES RISE ON FINELY BALANCED PHYSICALS Lead prices have risen this week against a background of a finely balanced physical sector, traders said. Further gains are possible if the USSR steps up its buying or if labour problems develop in North America, they added. London Metal Exchange (LME) prices are unusually buoyant at a time of year when seasonal demand is normally slackening and prices tending to drift lower. This buoyancy is generally attributed by traders to the low level of LME stocks and steady, if unspectacular, physical demand in the Northern Hemisphere finding supplies curtailed. The supply problems are not new but are beginning to be felt by a market in which, as peak winter demand tails off, stocks usually build fast and availability increases, traders said. The lower supply levels result from a number of different factors around the globe. Delayed shipments from Peru to Mediterranean countries because of production and transport problems, lack of Spanish exports since the closure last year of Cia La Cruz's smelter at Linares and lower output in Morocco and Greece have all meant additional demand being directed to merchants who in turn have been drawing on LME stocks. In addition Broken Hill Associated Smelters' Port Pirie, South Australia, smelter is halting production for five weeks for maintenance. Although the company said it would meet commitments, this will put further pressure on stocks. And the U.S. Company Doe Run has kept its 140,000 tonnes per year Boss, Montana smelter closed. This cut producer stocks and contributed to a closer supply/demand balance within the U.S. Market, for many years depressed by surplus production and a regular supplier to the world market. Mexican supplies, which have sometimes swelled LME stocks, have been normal but are finding ready buyers, traders said. On the demand side, winter battery manufacture has held up quite well and some U.S. Buying of lead sheet has been reported in the U.K. Soviet lead buying, notably absent in Europe in the first two months of the year, was resumed when a large buying order was filled by merchants in March. Merchant demand has fuelled the rise in LME lead prices this week and has seen cash metal move above 320 stg and establish a premium of around 10 stg over three months delivery. Specific demand has been directed towards metal in Gothenburg and Trieste warehouses. Gothenburg material is often a target for merchants shipping to the USSR, traders said. On stocks, the popular LME Continental warehouses, Antwerp and Rotterdam, have little more than 3,000 tonnes of lead each, and this is believed to be in strong hands. Out of a total 22,125 tonnes in LME stocks, the lowest level since June 1980, just over half is in U.K. Warehouses which are not popular with merchants putting together shipments. But even U.K. Stocks have dropped around 6,000 tonnes since the start of the year. Traders said this is partly due to secondary smelters buying ingots to supplement feed supplies affected by environmental controls, which put restrictions on the transport of used batteries. Labour negotiations in North America will play an important part in determining the direction of prices, with contracts expiring end-April at Cominco's Trail and Kimberley, B.C., Mine/smelter and at Doe Run's Herculaneum, Mo, smelter. Noranda's New Brunswick mine/smelter also has a contract expiry in July which may cause some nervousness in view of strikes by its zinc and copper workers over recent months. Traders said LME three months delivery, already attracting speculative buying, could rise to 320/330 stg on current firmness, while nearby tightness could widen the cash premium to 20 from four.

Despite failure of monsoon rains in recent years, it was possible to maintain higher foodgrain production, signifying growing resilience in agricultural sector, the report said.

The spokesman was commenting after VW had confirmed it would pay an unchanged 10 mark dividend for ordinary shares on 1986 business, despite the provision. One West German newspaper today quoted foreign currency dealers in Frankfurt as speculating that the total losses from the currency affair could be as high as 1.5 billion marks, but the VW spokesman described 480 mln marks as an \"upper limit.\" VW said in a statement following today's supervisory board meeting that it had discussed the foreign currency scandal in detail, and was setting up a new probe into its foreign currency activities to be carried out by an unnamed auditing company. VW has said computer programs were erased and documents were faked in the alleged fraud in which it believes transactions intended to protect it against possible foreign currency losses were not completed. VW's former foreign currency chief Burkhard Junger was arrested on Monday on suspicion of embezzlement and of having evaded justice. Earlier VW had said that its 1986 results would match 1985 profits. VW's group net profit in 1985 was 596 mln marks and parent company net was 477 mln marks. It also said it recommend an unchanged dividend to the supervisory board. The company has also set a dividend of 11 marks for new preference shares, which were issued last year. Analysts have described the held dividend as a move to reassure worried shareholders. VW increased nominal capital by 300 marks last year to 1.5 billion marks, with the result that its total dividend payment on 1986 will be 306 mln marks compared with 240 mln on 1985, since the new capital was in preference shares. The share analysts say VW will have to dig into reserves in order to maintain the disclosed 1986 profit at 1985 levels.

Speaking to journalists one day after the Group of Seven countries reaffirmed goals set in Paris six weeks ago, he said central banks would continue to intervene \"as and when necessary.\" He said the G-7 countries were concerned that Japan do more to stimulate domestic demand and welcomed measures outlined by Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa yesterday. Lawson said he was still worried about the risk of a simultaneous recession in the United States, Japan and West Germany, though less so than when he gave his March 17 budget speech to the British Parliament. \"If anything I'm a little bit less concerned, but there is still a risk,\" he said. Asked if the United States should consider increasing interest rates to support the dollar, he said, \"If there is a need for changes in relative interest rates, it doesn't need to be a rise in interest rates in the United States.\" Lawson said there was some concern expressed in yesterday's meetings at the slow progress the United States had made in reducing its budget deficit. \"We believe there will be some worthwhile progress in reducing the deficit this year. The important thing is that it continue year after year,\" Lawson said. The February 22 Louvre accord called for efforts to stabilize currencies at then-current exchange rates. In the six weeks that followed the Japanese yen continued to rise against the dollar despite massive central bank intervention. Asked whether this intervention was a sign of weakness in the Louvre accord, he said, \"I don't think so. If there had been no intervention you would have called that a sign of weakness.\" Although intervention could be a cause of inflation, Lawson said, \"the world does not appear to be in an inflationary mode ... but one has to be vigilant.\" He said yesterday's G-7 statement, which affirmed that \"current levels\" of exchange rates were appropriate, had been \"carefully worded.\" \"We know what we mean, and we all mean the same thing,\" he said. Lawson said financial markets seem to believe that Japanese measures outlined in the Louvre accord were the source of weakness for that agreement. Therefore, the G-7 countries welcomed Miyazawa's presentation of plans for a supplemental budget to stimulate domestic demand. They particularly welcomed the goal of an immediate increase in public works spending, but Lawson said the package also involved a second stage to increase expenditures during the second half of this year.", "labels": ["interest"]}, {"id": "test/15618", "text": "FRENCH FREE MARKET CEREAL EXPORT BIDS DETAILED French operators have requested licences to export 320,000 tonnes of free market barley, 225,000 tonnes of maize, 25,000 tonnes of free market bread-making wheat and 20,000 tonnes of feed wheat at today's EC tender, trade sources said.

But others say the upturn, based on strong orders and firm prices this spring, has been strictly seasonal and will end soon. They recommend taking profits. \"It's that time of year. This is strictly seasonal,\" said Charles Bradford of Merrill Lynch and Co. \"Orders will be strong for about two months, and there are signs that some (order rates) are starting to dive already.\" But Dean Witter Reynolds Inc analyst Clarence Morrison sees some short-term potential in the group, which includes USX Corp &lt;X>, Bethlehem Steel Corp &lt;BS>, Armco Inc &lt;AS> and Inland Steel Industries Inc &lt;IAD>. \"There is still some attractiveness to steels over the short- to intermediate-term based on improved order rates and rising prices,\" Morrison said. He only recommends one stock, however, Inland, which is modernizing steelmaking operations to make them more efficient. Despite his bearishness, Merrill's Bradford continues to recommend Armco, which he sees as a major turnaround. Armco's steelmaking operations are profitable, the balance sheet has been improved, and its oilfield equipment business has been slimmed and put in a joint venture with USX, Bradford noted. \"It's not a high-quality investment situation yet but they've come a long way,\" he said. \"We think the stock will do moderately better than the market,\" he said. Armco shares, trading off 1/4 at 10 today, could go to 12, and possibly as high as 15, he said. Bradford sees Armco earning 50 to 75 cts a share in 1987, before special gains from recouped investment tax credits, against losses last year. Armco's 1988 earnings could be significantly higher, he said. Bradford is recommending sale of USX shares. \"We had a buy on it below 20 but when it gets to 28, let somebody else have it,\" he said. The steel and energy concern will earn about one dlr a share in 1987, about half of that coming from asset sales, and from two dlrs to 2.50 dlrs in 1988, Bradford said. \"But a lot depends on oil prices,\" he added.

Analysts generally average the sales results of March and April to account for the variation of Easter's occurance. This year, Easter is being observed on April 19, which is three weeks later than last year. Analyst Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook Associates said sales for March rose an unadjusted 2.5 to 3.0 pct, and a seasonally adjusted 5.5 pct to six pct, compared to an adjusted 5.7 pct last year. \"The obvious question is whether these numbers indicate that the consumer activity is slowing, but it does not appear to be because liquidity and employment are rising,\" said analyst Jeff Edelman, analyst of Drexel Lambert and Burnham. Overall, analysts said first half sales are coming in according to expectations. Sales for all of 1987 are expected to rise about 5.5 pct to six pct, up a bit from 1986's rise. In March, sales of housewares, furniture and big ticket items were stronger than apparel sales, signaling to many analysts that apparel sales will be strong in April as the holiday nears. \"Sales gains in home appliances and home fashions reflect a continuing strength in the housing market,\" said Edward Brennan, chairman of Sears Roebuck and Co &lt;S> which reported an overall sales gain of 4.2 pct. Brennan said sales of women's sportswear were also excellent. \"Sears' total apparel sales was up only modestly, but even a modest improvement in apparel is a very good accomplishment due to the fact that most people will buy apparel in April,\" said C.J. Lawrence analysts Harry Mortner. J.C. Penney Co Inc &lt;JCP> and Dayton Hudson Corp &lt;DH> were among the weaker performers with comparable stores sales declining 1.5 pct and 4.9 pct, respectively. Penney's store and catalog sales declined 1.3 pct overall and Dayton Hudson's overall sales rose 4.8 pct. Penney chairman William Howell said, \"Sales continued strong for catalog operations and, geographically, ranged from very active in the east to weak in the economically depressed southwest.\" \"Penney's been shifting away from leisure time activity wear to other apparel lines, which yield higher profit margins, but are currently hurting sales,\" said Greenstein of Bear Stearns. Hudson chairman Kenneth Mackes cited the late Easter for the decline. Edelman of Drexel said that \"Hudson had a tougher comparison because it had an exceptionally good 1986.\" Most analysts agreed that promotions are slightly lower than last year. \"Retailers are not planning for much - inventories are being kept lean, markdowns are lower than last year, but sales are coming through anyway,\" said CJ Analyst Harry Mortner. Mortner said he expects profits in the first quarter to be better than he had originally expected in the beginning of the year. Most retailers report their first quarter in the middle of May.

The country has temporarily suspended beef exports to the EC because of the outbreak and awaits a decision from the EC veterinary committee, which is considering a formal ban. The outbreak in the country's main ranching province has already led neighbouring beef-producing Botswana and Zambia to bar beef and dairy imports from Zimbabwe, threatening the dairy industry with a loss of at least one mln dlrs in export revenue. \"The situation is still uncertain at the moment. Normally when an outbreak occurs there is an automatic suspension of beef exports,\" one industry source said yesterday. Commenting on EC policy, he explained, \"Depending on the seriousness of the outbreak the (veterinary) committee then decides on three options, allowing us to continue exporting beef from disease-free areas, clamping a three-month suspension on exports or banning us from exporting for a year. We are still awaiting their decision,\" he added, asking not to be identified. Zimbabwe was granted an export quota of 8,100 tonnes of high-grade beef to EC markets in 1985 after the country had spent millions of dollars erecting disease-control fences and upgrading abattoirs to meet stringent EC rules. Should the EC ban Zimbabwean exports, the country will be forced to sell its beef on glutted world beef markets at low prices, the source said.

The committee also voted for legally-binding quantity and quality requirements on the materials, mostly metals. The measures are a part of the Defense Authorization Bill which will be voted on in the House next month. The purpose of the measures, passed by the committee yesterday, is to improve stockpile management and discourage sell-offs of materials that could jeopardize strategic needs, a staff member of the committee told Reuters. \"They (the stockpiles) stand to gain the most by being managed properly,\" said the staffer. \"Management of the stockpile over the last 10 years has been atrocious.\" Responsibility for stockpile management now belongs to a White House agency, the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The staffer said under the measures passed by the committee the Secretary of Defense would have more influence over decisions to keep or sell strategic stockpile materials. The administration has proposed a goal of 700 million dlrs worth of strategic materials to be held in the stockpile. The stockpile now contains around 10 billion dlrs of materials. He said several agencies currently helped FEMA to manage the stockpile and decide how much to sell to help the deficit. These agencies included the Office of Management and Budget and the Departments of Interior and Commerce, he said.

The federal government reported today that the monthly surplus soared to 1.25 billion Canadian dlrs in February, double January's 623 mln dlrs surplus and sharply higher than February 1986's 189 mln dlr tally. \"Hopefully it's the beginning of a trend,\" said Richardson Greenshields of Canada Ltd economist Susan Clark in Toronto. Economists generally don't expect such large gains over the next months, but are looking for an upward trend throughout the year. \"We thought the trade balance would improve ... over the year, and it certainly looks as if this morning's figure is indicative of that,\" commented economist James Donegan at the Toronto securities firm of Midland Doherty Ltd. Statistics Canada reported the surplus was driven by a 23 pct gain in automobile product exports to a record 3.2 billion dls in the month. \"Recovery in the automotive sector helped push the value of exports up by 5.9 pct in February,\" the agency said in its monthly report. Total exports expanded to 10.44 billion dlrs from 9.85 billion dlrs in February, while imports slipped to 9.19 billion dlrs from 9.23 billion dlrs. Economists have predicted the 1987 trade surplus would end up three to five billion dlrs higher than last year's dismal 10.1 billion dlr total. In 1985 the surplus was 17.48 billion dlrs. Money market analysts said the positive trade news touched off a modest rally in the Canadian dollar, which rose to 76.85 U.S. cts on North American markets early this morning after closing at 76.58 cts Wednesday. The currency was hovering around 76.78 cts in early afternoon trading. Economists have been banking on an improved trade performance this year to stimulate an otherwise sluggish Canadian economy. Money market analysts said the positive trade news touched off a modest rally in the Canadian dollar, which rose to 76.85 U.S. cts on North American markets early this morning after closing at 76.58 cts Wednesday. The currency was hovering around 76.78 cts in early afternoon trading. Economists have been banking on an improved trade performance this year to stimulate an otherwise sluggish Canadian economy. They say the country's consumers, who have been spending at a torrid pace in recent years, will sharply curtail outlays this year and this should help curtail the flow of imports into the country. Meanwhile, demand for Canadian exports in the United States, by far the country's largest market, is expected to be strong as a result of a projected rise in American consumer spending and the relatively low value of the Canadian currency. \"We maintain what's going to drive Canada's export performance is income growth in the U.S.,\" said Midland's Donegan. But at the Bank of Nova Scotia, deputy chief economist Warren Jestin was less optimistic about the U.S. outlook and said it could be a mistake to read too much into February's trade upturn. Jestin said, \"Given the fact the U.S. economy is showing signs of weakening--particularly car sales--it would indicate that part of the strength (in Canada's trade figures) is probably transitory.\"", "labels": ["trade"]}, {"id": "test/15841", "text": "FIRST BANK &lt;FBS> SEES LOSS ON BRAZILIAN LOANS First Bank Systems Inc, in reporting higher first quarter net, said that if interest is not paid on the 140 mln dlrs in Brazilian loans and nine mln dlrs in Ecuadorian loans for the rest of 1987, its profits for the entire year will be cut by 6.9 mln dlrs.

The committee also voted for legally-binding quantity and quality requirements on the materials, mostly metals. The measures are a part of the Defense Authorization Bill which will be voted on in the House next month. The purpose of the measures, passed by the committee yesterday, is to improve stockpile management and discourage sell-offs of materials that could jeopardize strategic needs, a staff member of the committee told Reuters. \"They (the stockpiles) stand to gain the most by being managed properly,\" said the staffer. \"Management of the stockpile over the last 10 years has been atrocious.\" Responsibility for stockpile management now belongs to a White House agency, the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The staffer said that under the measures passed by the committee the Secretary of Defense would have more influence over decisions to keep or sell strategic stockpile materials. The administration has proposed a goal of 700 million dlrs worth of strategic materials to be held in the stockpile. The stockpile now contains around 10 billion dlrs of materials. He said several agencies currently helped FEMA to manage the stockpile and decide how much to sell to help the deficit. These agencies included the Office of Management and Budget and the Departments of Interior and Commerce, he said.

In its monthly report on the Soviet grain situation, the USDA said imports will be higher than earlier estimated because Soviet grain buyers have been actively purchasing in the last month. USDA said the increased purchasing is \"somewhat surprising\" because of recent higher Soviet crop estimates. All of the increase in estimated imports will be in corn, USDA said. Of the 28 mln tonnes total, 15 mln tonnes will be wheat, 12 mln tonnes coarse grains, and the remaining one mln tonnes miscellaneous grains and pulses, USDA said. USDA noted that the Soviet winter grain crop suffered through a severe winter and spring field work has been delayed. The severe winter \"is believed to have resulted in above average winter-kill,\" USDA said. Some grain trade analysts have said abnormal winter losses maybe one reason why the Soviet Union has been actively buying grain recently.

Lichtblau, president of Petroleum Industry Research Associates. Lichtblau, speaking at an alternative energy conference here, said the U.S. may depend on foreign suppliers for as much as 52 pct of its oil by 1995, surpasssing the previous high level of 47 pct in 1977. \"The long term growth in dependency on foreign oil is inevitable,\" Lichtblau said. As much as 30 pct of U.S. oil imports in 1995 could come from OPEC nations, he said. Lichtblau said the U.S. depended on foreign suppliers for 33 pct of its oil in 1986 and predicted that would increase to 40 pct by 1990. \"However, the rate of this growth can be affected positively or negatively through government action or inaction,\" Lichtblau said. He said that one of the government's negative actions is the maintenance of the windfall profits tax which acts as a disincentive to developing existing fields and reduces cash flow for oil exploration. Lichtblau called for the adoption of an international floor price for crude oil to help stabilize world oil prices. \"An international floor price adopted by all or most industrial countries would clearly be a much more effective measure and would be much less distortive for the U.S. than if we imposed it alone,\" Lichtblau said. Development of alternate energy sources such as synthetic fuels as well as increased development in Alaska could lessen U.S. dependency on foreign oil, Lichtblau said. A potential for alternative supplies could limit the willingness of OPEC nations to raise oil prices, he said.

Baker, however, said the IMF \"needs to move beyond macroeconomic indicators and find structural indicators that can help focus attention on some of the policies of specific relevance to the imbalances we face today.\" The Treasury Secretary said that indicators should be given a more prominent role in the annual economic reviews -- Article IV consultations -- that the Fund performs. Baker also told the policy making group that it was time for the IMF to adopt earlier recommendations making IMF surveillance more relevant to national policymakers and the public. \"In particular, we urge increased publicity for IMF appraisals developed in Article IV consultations, the use of follow-up reports on country actions to implement IMF recommendations, and greater use of special consultation procedures,\" he said. Baker emphasized that indicators were a device \"for moving beyond rhetoric to action.\" He said they provide \"more structure to the system, and induce more discipline and peer pressure into the process of policy coordination.\" He said the Fund's procedures for surveillance need to be reviewed and updated to reflect the use of indicators. \"This should be matter of priority for the executive board,\" he said. Baker also urged the Fund to develop alternative medium-term economic scenarios for countries that \"can help us focus even more clearly on the most important imbalances, by identifying options for addressing them and analyzing the implications of these options.\" He said also that further work should be done on finding paths that lead toward possible medium-term objectives. \"If we are to take effective remedial action when there are significant deviations from an intended course, then we must have more definitive ways of indentifying the right course for key variables,\" he said.", "labels": ["money-fx"]}, {"id": "test/16007", "text": "NERCI &lt;NER> UNIT CLOSES OIL/GAS ACQUISITION Nerco Inc said its oil and gas unit closed the acquisition of a 47 pct working interest in the Broussard oil and gas field from &lt;Davis Oil Co> for about 22.5 mln dlrs in cash.

Gains were most pronounced on the Commodity Exchange in New York, where gold jumped 12.40 dlrs and closed at 436.50 dlrs a troy ounce, and silver 22.5 cents to 6.86 dlrs a troy ounce. A key factor behind the advance was anticipation that inflation will be the only way for the major industrial nations to halt the slide in the value of the U.S. dollar, said Steve Chronowitz, director of commodity research with Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co., in New York. The dollar tumbled one day after top finance officials from the seven largest industrial nations reaffirmed their commitment to support its value, and despite reports of intervention by the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, traders said. Traders said it appears that the industrial nations, known as the Group of Seven, lack the ability to change the long-term direction of the currency markets. \"Maybe they have some ideas or plans,\" said Chronowitz. \"If they do, it's not evident.\" \"It looks like there's no cure but to let the free market take values to where they should be. \"One way or another, we will force our major trading partners to stimulate their economies,\" as a measure to correct the mounting U.S. trade deficit, Chronowitz said. \"I think the markets believe, and have believed for a long time, that the only recourse is to reflate at some point. It's going to be a long and tedious process, but that's what's happening,\" he said. The falling value of the dollar makes U.S. commodities cheaper for foreign buyers, stimulating demand. At the same time, traders who are holding stocks and bonds saw the value of their investments falling and many are turning to commodities such as precious metals as a hedge, said Marty McNeill, a metals analyst in New York with the trading house of Dominick and Dominick. The reaction in the metal markets reverberated throughout the commodities markets, as grains, livestock, and cotton posted broad gains. Traders at the Chicago Board of Trade said attention in the grain markets has shifted from concern about burdensome supplies to the outlook that a lower dollar will stimulate export demand. After the close of trading, the Agriculture Department raised its estimate for grain imports by the Soviet Union by two mln tonnes from the month-earlier report. Live hogs and frozen pork bellies posted sharp gains on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while live cattle were moderately higher. Analysts said several factors boosted hog prices.

Data out today show net borrowings from the Fed averaged 393 mln dlrs in the two weeks to Wednesday, up from 265 mln dlrs in the prior statement period. Wednesday borrowings were 1.4 billion dlrs as Federal funds averaged a high 6.45 pct. \"One could make a case that the Fed is firming, but it probably isn't,\" said William Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds. Sullivan said some may assume the Fed has firmed policy modestly to support the dollar because net borrowings in the two-weeks to Wednesday were nearly 400 mln dlrs after averaging around 250 mln dlrs over the previous two months. However, the Dean Witter economist noted that the latest two-week period included a quarter end when seasonal demand often pushes up borrrowings. \"Some might argue that the Fed was firming policy, but it looks like it tried to play catchup with reserve provisions late in the statement period and didn't quite make it,\" said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. A Fed spokesman told a press press conference today that the Fed had no large net one-day miss of two billion dlrs or more in its reserve projections in the week ended Wednesday. Still, McCarthy said it may have had a cumulative miss in its estimates over the week that caused it to add fewer reserves earlier in the week than were actually needed. The Fed took no market reserve management action last Thursday and Friday, the first two days of the week. It added temporary reserves indirectly on Monday via two billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements and then supplied reserves directly via System repurchases on Tuesday and Wednesday. Based on Fed data out today, economists calculated that the two-day System repurchase agreements the Fed arrranged on Tuesday totaled around 5.9 billion dlrs. They put Wednesday's overnight System repos at approximately 3.4 billion dlrs. \"It is quite clear that the Fed is not firming policy at this time,\" said Larry Leuzzi of S.G. Warburg and Co Inc. Citing the view shared by the other two economists, Leuzzi said the Fed cannot really afford to seriously lift interest rates to help the dollar because that would harm already weak economies in the United States and abroad and add to the financial stress of developing countries and their lenders. \"Those who believe the Fed tightened policy in the latest statement period have to explain why it acted before the dollar tumbled,\" said McCarthy of Merrill Lynch. He said the dollar staged a precipitous drop as a new statement period began today on disappointment yesterday's Washington meetings of international monetary officials failed to produce anything that would offer substantive dollar aid. In fact, currency dealers said there was nothing in Wednesday's G-7 communique to alter the prevailing view that the yen needs to rise further to redress the huge trade imbalance between the United States and Japan. The economists generally agreed that the Fed is aiming for steady policy now that should correspond to a weekly average Fed funds rate between six and 6-1/8 pct. This is about where the rate has been since early November. \"I'm not so sure that the Fed is engineering a tighter policy to help the dollar, as some suspect,\" said Sullivan of Dean Witter. If it is, however, he said that Fed probably has just nudged up its funds rate goal to around 6.25 to 6.35 pct from six to 6.10 pct previously.", "labels": ["dlr", "interest", "money-fx"]}, {"id": "test/16055", "text": "VALEX PETROLEUM INC &lt;VALP> YEAR DEC 31 Shr loss six cts vs loss 84 cts Net loss 219,632 vs loss 16.3 mln Revs 1.4 mln vs 2.8 mln NOTE:1985 net includes 15.5 mln dlrs of writedowns and tax benefit of 51,294.", "labels": ["earn"]}, {"id": "test/16063", "text": "N.Z.

For two years, the markets had hailed the dollar's decline as the cure-all for the U.S. Trade deficit. Interest rates fell sharply and Wall Street became a one-way street, up. But that confidence is now cracking as the financial markets suddenly believe Fed chairman Paul Volcker's often-repeated warnings about the risks of a dollar collapse. \"Volcker's been saying for a long time that a dollar freefall would be extremely dangerous - now he's got it,\" said David Jones, economist at Aubrey G. Lanston and Co Inc. The dollar fell below 144 yen today for the first time in 40 years as the Group of Seven finance ministers in Washington failed to convince the foreign exchange market that they have a credible strategy for redressing global trade imbalances, short of further depreciation of the dollar. Bonds suffered their biggest one-day drop in months amid worries that the dollar's slide will rekindle inflation, scare away foreign investors and force the Fed to tighten credit. The inflationary fears boosted gold bullion by more than 12 dlrs to a 1987 high of 432.20/70 dlrs an ounce, while the spike in interest rates pulled the Dow Jones Industrial Average down by 33 points to 2339. Norman Robertson, Mellon Bank chief economist, called the markets' instability frightening. He believes economic fundamentals do not justify the bearishness but said that \"once you start the ball rolling it's difficult to stop.\" \"There's a stark possibility that you could get a destabilizing drop in the dollar that forces up interest rates and drives us into recession. The markets are in a panic.\" Stephen Marris of the Institute for International Economics in Washington, has been warning for a long time that the controlled decline of the dollar since peaks of 3.47 marks and 264 yen in February 1985 could turn into a nightmare. \"We're still more or less on track for a hard landing... But the agony may be fairly drawn out,\" Marris told Reuters. Marris does not expect the crisis to peak until later this year, but he warned that the situation is so fragile that it would take very little to touch off what he calls the second phase of the hard landing, whereby a loss of confidence in the dollar pushes up interest rates and leads to a recession. The stock market's reaction today and its sharp drop on March 30 shows how the loss of confidence could come about. The fact that it has not happened yet is consistent with historical experience, which teaches that domestic markets are not affected until a currency is in the final stages of its decline, Marris said. He has forecast a drop to about 125 yen. Marris felt that a major impetus for the dollar's latest weakness was the loss of credibility that central banks suffered when they failed to prevent the dollar from falling below 150 yen, the floor that the market believes was set as part of the G-7 Paris agreement in February. Robertson at Mellon, by contrast, said the loss of confidence was triggered last week when Washington announced plans to slap 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on Japanese electronic imports, raising the specter of a debilitating trade war. Many economists believe that long-run stability will not return to the markets until the root cause of the trade gap is addressed - excessive consumption in the U.S., Reflected in the massive budget deficit. But in the short term, given the failure of the G-7 and of central bank intervention, some feel that the Fed will have no choice but to tighten credit to restore faith in the dollar. \"The only thing that will stop the dollar falling is a substantial increase in the discount rate and a corresponding cut abroad, at least by Japan,\" said Lanston's Jones. Marris expects the Fed to act quickly to raise interest rates, even at the risk of increasing the debt burden for American farmers, Latin American governments and others. But Robert Giordano, chief economist at Goldman Sachs and Co, scoffed at the notion. \"It's ridiculous to think the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates when the dollar is weak against just one currency. This is yen strength, not dollar weakness,\" he said. Giordano said the market was ignoring the progress being made toward reducing the U.S. Budget deficit. \"We're going to have one of the biggest reductions in the budget deficit relative to GNP in history this year, and nobody cares,\" he said, noting that only the deficit cut in 1968-69 will have been greater. He said he does not expect the dollar to collapse and thinks interest rates are likely to fall back later this year.

Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson told reporters earlier today that some countries - those with strong currencies - might have to cut interest rates. The Bank of Japan sources also said that it was too soon to call the G-7 pact a failure. The central bank sources were commenting on the dollar's renewed tumble in New York and Tokyo, which was sparked by remarks by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker that the dollar's fall had been orderly.

The closure of the Haitian American Sugar Company (HASCO) will idle 3,500 employees and affect as many as 30,000 to 40,000 small sugar cane planters in regions around the capital, the company said. \"Because of unprecedented and ever-growing smuggling, HASCO regrets ... It cannot continue to accept delivery of sugar cane after April 10,\" the mill warned planters earlier this week. Since President Jean-Claude Duvalier fled Haiti fourteen months ago, widescale smuggling of basic goods such as cooking oil, flour, rice, sugar and canned milk has lowered consumer prices but bankrupted several local manufacturers, throwing hundreds of thousands of Haitians out of work. At the HASCO compound, where grim-faced workers lined up to receive their last pay, Spokesman Georges D. Rigaud showed a warehouse stocked with an estimated 445,000 unsold 100-pound (45-kg) bags of sugar. \"We are closing because of our huge stock of unsold sugar. We have no money left to continue operations,\" Rigaud said. He said the company owed 7.6 mln dlrs and had borrowed an additional 1.5 mln dlrs in order to pay off workers. Rigaud blamed the mill's problems on an order by Duvalier two years ago forbidding HASCO from refining sugar. He said the government then began importing refined sugar at world market prices and reselling it at a huge profit and the provisional military-civilian government that replaced Duvalier last year continued the policy. \"But now with all the smuggling even the state can't compete with smuggled Dominican refined sugar,\" Rigaud said. HASCO workers earned 4.20 dlrs daily, considerably above the usual minimum wage of three dlrs. It is generally estimated that every employed Haitian supports at least six people.

The banks are holding up to seven mln dlrs in coffee money and President Yoweri Museveni is thinking of imposing a penalty for such delays, it added. Banking sources said a third factor in the crisis was that commercial banks have lent the board only 77 billion shillings -- the equivalent of 55 mln dlrs -- for crop finance in the current coffee year, while the government had asked for 100 billion. The CMB has 455,000 60-kg bags of coffee, about 15 pct of annual production, stockpiled in Kampala awaiting shipment. The crop accounts for over 90 pct of Uganda's export earnings and the recent slide in prices to four-year lows is likely to more than offset an expected increase in production. CMB officials have forecast that because the government has restored law and order in important growing areas, Uganda will produce over three mln bags of coffee in the year ending September 30, about 25 pct more than in 1985/6.", "labels": ["coffee"]}, {"id": "test/16098", "text": "W.GERMAN COCOA GRIND UP 2.9 PCT IN FIRST QUARTER The West German cocoa grind rose 2.9 pct to 55,190 tonnes in the first quarter of 1987 from 53,643 tonnes in the same quarter of of 1986, the Bonn-based Confectionery Industry Association said in a statement.

They said some 71,070 tonnes of agricultural produce estimated at about 250 mln pesos was lost to the lack of rainfall. They warned of a severe drought if the prevailing conditions continued until next month. Agriculture Secretary Carlos Dominguez said he hoped the losses would be offset by the expected increase in output in other, normally more productive areas not affected by the dry spell. Affected were 14,030 hectares of palay (unmilled rice), representing a production loss of 22,250 tonnes valued at 77.8 mln pesos, Department of Agriculture reports said. About 48,820 tonnes of corn from 97,320 hectares valued at 170.8 mln pesos have also been lost, they said. Officials said the hectarage planted to palay that has been hit by the drought accounted for only one pct of national total thus the damage is considered negligible. In the case of corn, they said the loss can be filled by production from non-traditional corn farms which diversified into the cash crop from sugar two years ago.

Dome is trying to get approval for a plan to refinance debt of more than 4.5 billion dlrs by July 1, 1987, when an interim debt plan that allowed the Canadian oil and gas firm to defer substantial payments to creditors will expire. Analysts said TransCanada's bid signals Dome's debtholders that an alternative exists to Dome's debt plan. Dome announced its plan to 56 major creditors as well as public noteholders in March after several months of delicate negotiations. TransCanada's proposal \"amounts to a quasi debt restructuring,\" oil analyst Doug Gowland of Brown Baldwin Nisker Ltd said from Toronto. Calgary-based Dome's restructuring plan would allow creditors to convert debt to common shares under a formula yet to be negotiated. Payments on remaining debt would be linked to cash flow generated by assets pledged against the debt. \"The weakness of the whole debt-refinancing proposal is that even with approval of creditors, there is no assurance that Dome will in fact be able to repay all of its debt obligations,\" said Wilf Gobert, an oil analyst for Peters and Co Ltd in Calgary. TransCanada's announcement came as a surprise since Dome was waiting for responses from creditors on its proposed refinancing packages, Gobert said. The TransCanada proposal could open the bidding for Dome since other potential buyers were probably waiting for lenders to agree to a restructuring, he added. \"I would think that the debtholders would want to entertain any and all offers (for Dome),\" Gobert said. Dome spokesman David Annesley said in New York that TransCanada's announcement could be seen as an attempt to fix the bidding price for Dome and an effort to preclude other possible buyers from making an offer. \"By drawing attention to us in our discussions, it means that others may be a little reluctant to come forward,\" he said.

Diplomatic sources here said several recent actions by EC countries bear witness to a new disillusionment with the willingness, or at least the ability, of the Japanese government to reduce its massive trade surplus with the EC. However, they said an all-out trade war may be far off, as EC states know they would suffer almost as much as Japan. Senior EC diplomats gave a generally favourable reaction to an EC executive commission proposal under which the EC could raise tariffs on a range of Japanese products if the U.S. Carries out a threat to make a similar move on April 17. The EC tariffs, which would involve renouncing obligations entered into with the world trade body GATT, would be designed to stop a diversion of exports to the EC market from that of the U.S. The diplomats were meeting as Tokyo announced that the EC's trade deficit with Japan reached a record 2.13 billion dlrs in March, up from 1.94 billion in February. In 1986, Japanese exports to the EC totalled 30.67 billion dlrs, up 4.5 pct from 1985, while EC exports to Japan fell one pct to 12.43 billion dlrs. In Paris, trade minister Michel Noir said France has decided to give Japan a taste of its own medicine. Burgeoning imports of microwave ovens and of frozen Coquilles St Jacques will be restricted by a strict application of French quality standards -- something EC states say often happens to their own exports entering Japan. Britain has threatened to withdraw the licences of Japanese banks and insurance companies to operate in the City of London, because the British Cable and Wireless company lost out in competition for a Japanese telecommucations contract. However, British officials in London have said that the government may have gone too far in implying that it would take immediate drastic action unless the contract was reopened. By contrast, West Germany, with the EC's most successful economy, has never threatened Tokyo with sanctions, preferring to rely on firm diplomacy and encouragement of its own industries to surmount obstacles to export to Japan. The EC Commission itself has switched its tactics in recent years, substituting general calls for action by Japan to open its market with specific demands for moves in key areas. At present, it is, for instance, pressuring Japan to end allegedly discriminatory taxation of imported wines and spirits, to ensure EC companies have a chance to win contracts for the building of a new international airport, and to simplify certification and safety checks on imported cars. EC officials say these tactics yield some benefits, but often the Japanese announce modifications of their non-tariff barriers which open the door to imports by only a token amount. They stress, however, that any action must be taken by the EC as a whole to stop beggar-my-neighbour action.

Condon did not say who had made the predictions, but an AWB spokesman said there was a general industry feeling that farmers, hard hit by low prices and rising costs, could cut back plantings sharply. Wheat sowing normally begins in May. However, Condon said he did not believe plantings would be cut by as much as 30 pct although he realised many farmers were facing enormous financial pressures. He said the AWB expects the area sown to be about 10.7 mln hectares, down from 11.3 mln in 1986/87 when the crop was about 16 mln tonnes.

If the AWB is unable, because of a short-term cut in plantings, to meet the needs of the markets it has developed with much time and effort, it may have great difficulty selling wheat to those markets in the future, Condon said. \"Markets which rely on a steady supply of Australian wheat understand a decrease in production due to drought but they will have difficulty understanding a deliberate decision to decrease production,\" Condon said. \"If Australia wants wheat to continue as a major export income earner, governments and government authorities will need to closely examine ways of contributing to the continuing viability of the wheat industry,\" he added.

Oral proceedings were held in the Hague on Friday and the court said it would give its verdict within six weeks. \"However, that is the normal wording and we expect the Hague court to refer questions on the interpretation and application of the levy to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg,\" Pex added. Het Comite claims the way the levy is applied does not take account of currency cross-rates of exchange and can mean a compounder in one country being asked to pay a higher levy in its own national currency than it received down the chain from the original producer of the grain. \"We would like the Business Administration Court in the Hague to ask the Luxembourg Court of Justice not only whether the Dutch Grain Commodity Board, the levy collection agency, has interpreted the levy regulations correctly, but also whether the regulations themselves may contravene European law,\" Pex said. \"It is only with great regret that we have taken this route, but we have had no political help, and therefore have no option even though it could take years,\" Pex added. Het Comite asked CHV to act as a test case against the grain levy because the bill the company received from the commodity board included grain from a wide variety of origins and was therefore considered to be the best general basis for a legal challenge to the levy, Pex noted.

The three research groups of Kiel, Hamburg and Essen predicted in the institutes' joint spring report that gross national product (GNP) would rise by two pct in 1987, compared with 2.4 pct in 1986. The five institutes had jointly forecast three pct 1987 growth in October last year. Taking a dissenting view, the DIW institute of West Berlin and Munich's Ifo institute predicted only one pct 1987 growth. The joint report said that the estimates of economic development made by the DIW and Ifo were \"markedly less favourable\" than those of the other three. The DIW and Ifo forecast the economy would pick up after a slow start to the year. \"In the second half of 1987 there will, however, only be a weak upward movement,\" they said. The two institutes said external economic factors which were currently damaging exports and pushing up imports would dominate the economic environment throughout the year. They saw exports falling by a real 2-1/2 pct in 1987 and predicted no marked improvement in the course of the year. The other three institutes, however, wrote: \"The decline in demand and production (seen) in the winter months does not indicate the beginning of a cyclical downswing.\" They said the sharp rise of the mark had led to corporate uncertainty and companies had not carried out investment plans. But they expected that many investments had not been cancelled but only put off. \"It can be presumed that the braking actions (on the economy) will diminish markedly this year.\" They added: \"The domestic prerequisites for a continuation of the economic uptrend are still favourable.\" These three institutes said diminishing external burdens combined with favourable domestic conditions meant an upturn in demand and production could be expected by the spring. However, this projection was clouded by risks including the further development of the mark against the dollar. Contrary to the DIW and Ifo, the three institutes said that while exports would continue to be the weak point of the economy in 1987, \"there is good reason to believe that exports will soon bottom out and that a slight rise will emerge during the course of the year.\" They predicted an overall 0.5 pct fall in exports in 1987, the same as in 1986. The three more positive institutes saw private consumption rising by four pct in 1987, compared with 4.2 pct in 1986, while DIW and Ifo predicted a three pct increase. They saw the climate for equipment investment improving but predicted only a rise of four pct in 1987 against 4.6 pct in 1986. Ifo and DIW saw these investments rising by only two pct. All the institutes predicted only a slight decline in unemployment. The Kiel, Hamburg and Essen institutes said the jobless total would average 2.17 mln in 1987 compared with 2.23 mln in 1986 and predicted a rise in the number of people in work of about 200,000. These three institutes said new jobs would be created mainly in the private services sector and also by the state in the context of job creation measures. The construction industry was likely to engage new workers for the first time since 1980 but they predicted either no rise in employment in the manufactured goods industry or only a slight expansion. The DIW and Ifo said rises in employment would occur only in the tertiary sector, while \"the number employed in the manufacturing industry will decline.\" The DIW and Ifo said unemployment would only decline to 2.20 mln in 1987 from 2.23 mln in 1986. They saw the current account surplus falling in 1987 to 58 billion marks from 78 billion in 1986. The other three saw a current account surplus in 1987 of at least 60 billion marks and predicted that the trade surplus would fall to only around 100 billion marks from 112 billion in 1986.

A Borg-Warner spokeswoman said members of management do not plan to participate in the transaction, but they will retain their positions with the company. A spokesman for GAF was unavailable for comment. GAF holds 19.9 pct of Borg-Warner's shares. GAF had said it would offer 46 dlrs per share. Borg-Warner's spokeswoman said the company still plans to sell its financial services unit, which includes Wells Fargo security guards, and the Chilton Corp, a credit rating service.

In their joint spring report the institutes were divided about 1987 growth forecasts, with three predicting two pct expansion and the other two only one pct growth. Gross national product grew 2.4 pct last year. But the report said all the institutes believed that \"more must be done to produce dynamic growth so that more additional jobs can be created.\" The institutes said any step which improved basic economic conditions should be taken as quickly as possible. \"From this point of view, the tax reform planned for 1990 should be brought forward.\" The government plans gross tax reductions of 44 billion marks as part of the major tax reform.

The government has not specified how the remaining 19 billion marks of the tax reduction package will be paid for, though it has said it wants to cut state subsidies. The institutes said this lack of clarity from Bonn had caused uncertainty among companies and households as to what exactly they would receive from the tax reform and urged a quick decision from the government. They also said the government should reduce tax preferences, which would simplify the fiscal system, urged a restriction of state spending and called for no increase in value-added tax. The institutes also criticised Bonn for increasing subsidies at a time further reductions had been pledged. They referred specifically to a doubling of special writedowns for small and medium sized companies announced in a package of tax adjustments planned for 1988 and described this as an increase in subsidies. The institutes said total subsidies, including tax preferences, had reached 80 billion marks in 1985 and risen further since then. Given the scope of these subsidies, it should be possible \"despite ... Major political difficulties\" to finance the tax reform by cutting state handouts. The institutes said that if the government raised value added tax or other indirect taxes a large portion of the positive effects resulting from lower taxes would be lost.

Senior Japanese, U.S. And European officials in Tokyo say they are at a loss to fully explain the data, for if currencies are the key they ask, why then are are U.S. Exports to Japan shrinking? What if manipulating currencies and driving the dollar down made world trade problems worse rather than solving them, fulfilling Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker's forecast of world trade recession? U.S.-Japan trade has declined even after a 40 pct dollar fall against the yen since the September 1985 Group of Five pact in New York. The lower dollar ought to have made U.S. Exports 40 pct more competitive in Japan. The officials, most of them economists, can offer no objective reason why they are not. Worse, how are European Community sales to Japan rising rapidly when the European Currency Unit has until now declined only 11 pct against the yen.? Last week's G-7 meeting in Washington has been widely interpreted as a sign from the policy makers that the dollar must go lower. So worst of all, what if Volcker is correct? At a loss to give an objective explanation, officials can only offer explanations which tend to be highly subjective. \"I don't know and I don't think anyone knows,\" said Hugh Richardson, acting head of the EC delegation in Tokyo. \"What I do know is that Community exporters are making a hell of an effort in this market. If you make an effort, there is money to be made in Japan,\" he added. But U.S. Officials and businessmen are convinced low U.S. Exports to Japan are Japan's fault. They cite restrictive trade practices, protected Japanese trade sectors, such as agriculture, and non-tariff barriers, such as unreasonable checking and customs procedures for car imports. Publicly, Japanese officials remain conciliatory in the face of what they see as U.S. Aggression. In private, they blame U.S. Industry for being uncompetitive. \"We see it that way, but we don't like to seem arrogant,\" said a senior official, who declined to be named. \"We like to refrain from accusing them of not making enough effort.\" Industrialists such as Eishiro Saito, chairman of the Keidanren business group, and Sony Corp chairman Akio Morita repeatedly accuse foreign firms of not making enough effort to understand Japan's markets, and some foreigners agree. \"The real issue is the inability of major sectors of American and European industry to compete not only internationally but even in their home markets,\" Peter Huggler, President of Interallianz Bank Zurich, told a recent conference in Switzerland.

The year-on-year rise was put at 3.7 pct, down from 4.2 pct in February. But Chris Tinker, economist at brokerage house Phillips and Drew, said the drop in the year-on-year rate mainly reflected a rise in excise duties which affected the index in March last year. He cautioned that it was dangerous to read too much into the monthly figure, adding that a rise of only 0.2 pct in April would take the year-on-year rise back above 4.2 pct. Analysts also noted that a drop in manufacturers' input prices was almost entirely due to anticipated seasonal factors such as a fall in industrial electricity costs. Duncan Squire of Lloyds Merchant Bank said the figures were slightly disappointing in that the strengthening of sterling had not yet reduced input prices as much as expected.

Monetary sources said officials were exasperated that the markets, which drove the dollar rapidly lower and severely disrupted bond and stock markets too, did not take heed of the policy commitments of the Group of Seven -- the United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada. Treasury Secretary James Baker went out of his way to reassure markets of his commitment to a stable dollar with a statement, and French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur underscored that by saying: \"I don't believe at all that the Americans want a weaker dollar.\" West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said the dollar's latest rapid descent \"involves the risk -- now already a tangible threat -- of a new strong surge of inflation, leading to a renewed rise in interest rates.\" But there were signs too, that while policymakers feared the market uproar, they seemed to accept there was little they could do until the economic picture changed, and currencies settled into a stable pattern as a result. Nor did there seem to be any enthusiasm at last week's semi-annual meetings of the IMF and the World Bank for higher U.S. Interest rates as the best way to curb the dollar's rapid descent. That distaste stems in part from fears of recession. Outgoing Deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman told television interviewers he did not think a policy of driving the dollar down would solve the U.S. trade deficit. \"It would slow growth in Germany and Japan which would adversely affect our trade balance and ultimately it would drive interest rates up here which would throw us, if not (into) recession, into slower growth,\" he said. Asked if higher U.S. Interest rates would stabilize the dollar, Balladur said: \"When a currency is maintained artificially high, by artificially high interest rates, it is not healthy.\" And resorting to higher interest rates could lead to recession, he said. Acknowledging the dollar's latest slide was now a fact of life, Balladur said, \"there may be adjustments of course in one or other currencies, this is not a fixed rate system.\" But Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker said he might rein in credit if the dollar's slide deepens. U.S. Monetary sources also said Washington wanted it understood by markets the seven's commitments were genuine. \"The United States and the six major industrial countries are fully committed to implementing our undertakings in these agreements,\" Baker told the meetings. Darman said Baker had been misinterpreted by markets which wrongly believed earlier remarks suggested he wanted a further decline in the dollar. Baker, Darman said, was committed to stabilizing currencies at current levels. Last week's statement from the seven reaffirmed a February 22 agreement in Paris in which the Reagan administration agreed to reach a budget deficit compromise with Congress and to fight protectionism. West Germany and Japan, meanwhile, agreed to stimulate domestic demand and lead a global upturn. Ministers believed the Paris pact was bolstered by Japan's promise of a 35 billion dlr supplementary budget. The sources said they believed Baker saw it as a major action. But the seven seem to accept their commitment to stable currencies applied to today's exchange rates and not those at the time of the Paris agreement, when the dollar stood higher. The Paris accord said, \"currencies (are) within ranges broadly consistent with underlying economic fundamentals, given the policy commitments summarized in this statement.\" Now they accept the dollar's lower level, especially against the yen, as hard reality that is nonetheless consistent with the agreement. \"The ministers and governors reaffirmed the view that around current levels their currencies are within ranges broadly consistent with fundamentals,\" last week's statement read. Monetary sources said policymakers understood markets were focusing on instability created by the gap between the U.S. Trade deficit and the surpluses of West Germany and Japan rather than prospective policy changes.

Dome is trying to get approval for a plan to refinance debt of more than 4.5 billion dlrs by July 1, 1987, when an interim debt plan that allowed the Canadian oil and gas firm to defer substantial payments to creditors will expire. Analysts said TransCanada's bid signals Dome's debtholders that an alternative exists to Dome's debt plan. Dome announced its plan to 56 major creditors as well as public noteholders in March after several months of delicate negotiations. TransCanada's proposal \"amounts to a quasi debt restructuring,\" oil analyst Doug Gowland of Brown Baldwin Nisker Ltd said from Toronto. Calgary-based Dome's restructuring plan would allow creditors to convert debt to common shares under a formula yet to be negotiated. Payments on remaining debt would be linked to cash flow generated by assets pledged against the debt. \"The weakness of the whole debt-refinancing proposal is that even with approval of creditors, there is no assurance that Dome will in fact be able to repay all of its debt obligations,\" said Wilf Gobert, an oil analyst for Peters and Co Ltd in Calgary. TransCanada's announcement came as a surprise since Dome was waiting for responses from creditors on its proposed refinancing packages, Gobert said. The TransCanada proposal could open the bidding for Dome since other potential buyers were probably waiting for lenders to agree to a restructuring, he added. \"I would think that the debtholders would want to entertain any and all offers (for Dome),\" Gobert said. Dome spokesman David Annesley said in New York that TransCanada's announcement could be seen as an attempt to fix the bidding price for Dome and an effort to preclude other possible buyers from making an offer. \"By drawing attention to us in our discussions, it means that others may be a little reluctant to come forward,\" he said.

In a newspaper advertisement, Sosnoff said the bid by his MTS Acquisition Corp, withdrawal rights and the proration period will now expire June 19 unless extended. The offer had been scheduled to expire May 15. In late March, Sosnoff said he had received a \"negligible\" number of shares in response to the offer, which had been rejected by Caesars as inadequate. Sosnoff already owns about four mln of Caesars' 30 mln common shares now outstanding, or a 13.3 pct interest on a primary basis. Last week, Caesars' board approved a recapitalization plan as an alternative to the Sosnoff offer under which shareholders would receive a special dividend of 25 dlrs per share, subject to approval by shareholders at a special meeting to be held in June. The company planned to borrow 200 mln dlrs and sell 800 mln dlrs in debt to finance the payout. Sosnoff said in the newspaper advertisement that the amended offer is conditioned on receipt of enough shares to give him a majority interest on a fully diluted basis and on the arrangement of financing, as well as to approvals by New Jersey and Nevada gaming authorities. He said the tender would be the first step in acquiring all of Caesars' shares and if successful would be followed by a merger transaction. Sosnoff said later in a statement that the 29.1 mln shares he is now seeking, together with the 4,217,675 shares he owns, would give him a 92.4 pct interest on a fully diluted basis. He said he still has received only a \"negligible\" number of shares in response to his tender. In a letter to Caesars' chairman Henry Gluck included in the statement, Sosnoff said Gluck had again refused, on April 8, to meet with him, even though he had said he was willing to increase the price of his offer. Sosnoff said the financing for the offer is almost fully in place. Sosnoff said PaineWebber Group Inc &lt;PWJ> has now delivered to him commitments to purchase up to 475 mln dlrs of increasing dividend cumulative exchangeable preferred stock of MTS Holding Corp, an indirect parent corporation of MTS Acquisition. He said Marine Midland Banks Inc &lt;MM>, which leads a syndicate that has provided commitments for a 500 mln dlr margin facility, believes it will be able to arrange for further commitments under the margin facility to advance up to an additional 25 mln dlrs that may be needed to permit the purchase of shares under the offer. Sosnoff said under the merger that would follow his tender, each of the 2,750,000 Caesars shares not covered by the offer, or 7.6 pct on a fully diluted basis, would be converted into Series A preferred stock valued at 32 dlrs per shareby an independent investment baking firm. He said \"To the extent that fewer than 29,100,000 sdhares are purchased in the offer, the stockholders would receive a combination of cash and Series A preferred stock having a value of 32 dlrs per share of Caesars.\" Sosnoff said he believes terms of his offer are superior to Caesars' recapitalization. Sosnoff said he will be meeting this week with gaming officials in Nevada in an effort to expedite the investigatory process required for regulatory approval, a process that it already underway in New Jersey.

But the April 3 ousting of Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva's government could slow economic reforms and investment as Portugal continues to adapt to membership in the European Community, which it joined in January last year, they said. Cavaco Silva's minority Social Democratic Party, PSD, was toppled in a parliamentary censure vote by left-wing parties. The centre-right administration had made economic growth reform a priority in its 17 months in office. In 1986, Portugal's economy grew four pct, its current account surplus swelled to more than one billion dlrs and inflation fell to 10 pct, from 20 pct in 1985. Analysts and businessmen said the prospects of instability were worrying but they felt the foundations for continued growth had not been badly shaken. \"The economy has developed a certain self-confidence that is now less dependent on the political situation,\" said Fritz Haser, economics professor at Universidade Livre, Lisbon. \"The market doesn't see this as a real crisis yet,\" economist Jorge Braga de Macedo told Reuters. Businessmen have identified political instability over the last 13 years as one of the biggest obstacles to lasting economic progress. The PSD administration was the 16th formed since the 1974 revolution. Portugal's developing stock markets, however, remain buoyant. Brokers and unit trust managers said the recent surge in economic confidence under the PSD rule was still largely underpinned by continuing optimistic forecasts. Investment grew nearly 10 pct in 1986 and a Bank of Portugal forecast, released on the day the PSD government fell, predicted the pace of investment and overall economic growth would remain at similar levels this year. But analysts said the crisis interrupted current policies and could slow economic development. Soares, who is expected to announce a decision by the end of the month, can either call early elections or form a new government from parties in the existing left wing-dominated parliament. Many businessmen said they strongly favoured quick elections as the best solution. \"There is a good chance that a majority government could result from early elections,\" Confederation of Portuguese Industry (CIP) president Pedro Ferraz da Costa said. He said they were optimistic this could mean the continuation in the near future of liberalisation policies introduced over the last year. The left-wing parties favour a parliamentary solution, but the PSD said it wants an early election in which opinion polls say they could win an overall majority. A PSD majority would also open the way for more wide-ranging reforms, such as relaxation of labour laws and possible denationalisation of industry, the analysts said. Cavaco Silva has accused the left-wing opposition parties of blocking key economic reforms. The left-wingers said Portugal's positive economic results were more the product of favourable international conditions such as cheaper oil and raw material imports, than of PSD policies.", "labels": ["bop", "cpi", "gnp"]}, {"id": "test/16228", "text": "MERRILL LYNCH FIRST QTR SHR ONE DLR VS 85 CTS MERRILL LYNCH FIRST QTR SHR ONE DLR VS 85 CTS", "labels": ["earn"]}, {"id": "test/16230", "text": "MERRILL LYNCH AND CO &lt;MER> 1ST QTR NET Shr primary one dlr vs 85 cts Shr diluted 97 cts vs 81 cts Net 108.6 mln vs 86.8 mln Rev 2.70 billion vs 2.17 billion", "labels": ["earn"]}, {"id": "test/16232", "text": "CORONA &lt;ICR.TO> FAVORS ROYEX &lt;RGM.TO> OFFER International Corona Resources Ltd said its board of directors believes that terms of Royex Gold Mining Corp's previously announced offer are fair and reasonable, but it decided it will make no recommendation on the offer to its shareholders.

Recently, the Columbia Gas System Inc pipeline subsidiary said, FERC denied on procedural grounds and without prejudice a proposal to include these costs in the company's most recent purchased gas adjustment -- or PGA -- filing. Noting it has has asked for a rehearing on the denial ruling, Columbia Gas said it would withdraw its alternative filing if the commission grantes its request for a rehearing to include the contract renegotiation costs in its PGA or consolidates this issue in the pipeline's general rate filing and permit recovery, subject to refund, effective April one. The company said the alternative filing seeks to recover about 79 mln dlrs a year through the pipeline's non-gas sales commodity rates. This annual amortization amount is based on recovery of about 653 mln drls over an 8-1/4 year period, beginning April 1, 1987. Columbia Gas said the filing would increase the pipeline commodity rates by 15.74 cts per mln Btu to 2.95 dlrs per mln. The company said it orginially sought to include these costs in its PGA since the payments to products resulted in almost five billion dlrs in prospective price relief and were not related to take-or-pay buyout costs. It explained this interpretation was based on FERC's April 10, 1985, Statement of Policy which said that only take-or-pay buyout costs must be recovered through a general rate filing under the Natural Gas Act. As a result of renegotiating contracts for high-cost gas, Columbia Gas said, it has been able to reduce the average price paid for gas purchased from Southwest producers to 1.96 dlrs per mln Btu in December 1986 from 3.64 dlrs per mln in April 1985.

But in a dissenting view the DIW institute in West Berlin, echoing recent statements by leading Bundesbank officials, said the expansion seen over the last 1-1/2 years did not necessarily threaten stability. The five institutes issued a joint spring report, in which three -- Kiel, Hamburg and Essen -- forecast a two pct rise in GNP in 1987, while West Berlin and Munich predicted one pct. The four institutes said an expansive policy was welcome in view of the slowdown in economic activity. But experience has shown that strong monetary growth eventually leads to a price rise which undoes the beneficial effects of monetary policy. Given virtual zero inflation in West Germany such fears may seem exaggerated, they said. \"But it has often turned out in the past that the price climate can quickly deteriorate, forcing the central bank into a restrictive policy,\" they said. The economic costs of a preventive stability policy are less than fighting inflation once it has taken hold, they said. The four institutes disputed the view that monetary expansion would slow of its own accord in 1987 as domestic investors switch liquidity into longer term capital market investments following lower interest rates. \"Such redispositions may temporarily dampen the expansion of central bank money stock, but do not automatically lead to a smaller expansion of money supply,\" they said. A return to growth and stability did not require spectacular central bank moves, but could be done quietly with open market operations and repurchase pacts, which would avoid an interest rate rise by dampening inflationary expectations. The DIW institute said monetary policy should not be focused simply on growth of production potential. Because of uncertainty about exchange rate developments and economic weakness other factors should be taken into account. Monetary policy should aim for further interest rate cuts and avoid rises to boost the economy and discourage revaluation speculation. Recent strong monetary expansion was not a threat in itself to price stability.

Wang Der-Hwa, Deputy Director of the Finance Ministry's Customs Administration Department, told reporters the list of products included 60 items asked by Washington. \"The move is part of our government efforts to encourage imports from our trading partners, particularly from the United States,\" he said. He said the ministry sent a proposal today to the cabinet that the tariffs on such products as cosmetics, bicycles, apples, radios, garments, soybeans and television sets be cut by between five and 50 pct. The cabinet was expected to give its approval next Thursday and the new tariff cuts would be implemented possibly starting on April 20, he added. Taiwan introduced a sweeping tariff cut on some 1,700 foreign products last January aimed at helping reduce its growing trade surplus with the United States, the island's largest trading partner. Washington however was not satisfied with the cuts and pressed for more reductions as a way of cutting its huge trade deficit with Taipei. Washington's deficit with Taipei rose to a record 13.6 billion U.S. Dlrs last year from 10.2 billion in 1985.

Chemical reported first-quarter net income of 86.2 mln dlrs, down from 102.6 mln a year earlier, but declaring the Brazilian loans non-performing cost Chemical 21 mln dlrs in lost interest income, or 12 mln dlrs after-tax. A 13.3 pct jump in non-interest expense to 471.3 mln dlrs from 415.9 mln also hit the bottom line. It said the rise was mainly due to staff costs associated with continued growth in consumer, capital markets and investment banking activities. Excluding the effect of placing Brazil on non-accrual, Chemical said its net income would have been 98.2 mln dlrs, or 4.3 pct below 1986 earnings. Brazil suspended interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term debt on February 20. If they are not resumed by year's end, Chemical said its after-tax net for the whole of 1987 will be reduced by about 51 mln dlrs. Chemical also placed 52 mln dlrs of loans to Ecuador on non-accrual because the Quito government also suspended interest payments on its foreign debt. This reduced interest income by 1.5 mln dlrs. Chemical said net interest income fell to 476.4 mln dlrs from 488.9 mln and its net spread narrowed to 3.61 pct from 3.96 pct. This reflected the reclassification of Brazilian loans, a reduced federal income tax rate (which affected the calculation of the taxabale-equivalent adjustment on tax-exempt assets) and a narrowing of the spread between the prime rate and Chemical's cost of funds. Foreign exchange trading profits rose to 37.9 mln dlrs from 27.0 mln, but bond trading profits dropped to 21.9 mln dlrs from 26.2 mln.

Most analysts said they were pleasantly surprised by IBM's performance. But they indicated that IBM's chances for a full recovery hinged on several key factors whose impact will not be felt until later in the year. These include the success of IBM's new personal computer line, introduced two weeks ago, and its 9370 minicomputers, which will begin volume shipments in July. In addition, IBM has said the full benefits of its early-retirement program and other cost-cutting moves will emerge as the year progresses. Analysts noted that IBM chairman John F. Akers was relatively more upbeat in assessing the company's outlook than he has been for nearly a year. \"Although the worldwide economic situation remains unsettled, there are some encouraging signs in our business,\" Akers said, pointing to, among other things, higher first-quarter shipments. \"We remain optimistic about the prospects for both the industry and IBM,\" he said. \"Akers was most encouraging,\" said PaineWebber's Smith. A weak dollar, a lower tax rate and strong mainframe computer sales all contributed to the better-than-expected first-quarter results, analysts said. \"Shipments of the 3090 mainframes were very strong in March,\" after a weak January and February, said Ulric Weil of Washington-based Weil and Associates. Sales of the top-of-the-line mainframes, commonly called the Sierras, \"bailed out the whole quarter,\" Weil said, adding, \"If this continues, it augers well for the rest of the year.\" REUTER...^M", "labels": ["earn"]}, {"id": "test/16432", "text": "MICRO MASK INC &lt;NMS.O> 2ND QTR MAR 31 OPER LOSS Oper shr loss 20 cts vs loss 63 cts Oper net loss 439,000 vs loss 1,347,000 Sales 6,303,000 vs 5,062,000 Six mths Oper shr loss 43 cts vs loss 1.02 dlrs Oper net loss 934,000 vs loss 2,333,000 Sales 12.1 mln vs 9,878,000 Note: oper data does not include 1986 losses from discontinued operations of 60,000 dlrs, or three cts per shr, in qtr and 151,000 dlrs, or seven cts per shr, in six mths.", "labels": ["earn"]}, {"id": "test/16433", "text": "JAPANESE CRUSHERS BUY CANADIAN RAPESEEED Japanese crushers bought 3,000 to 4,000 tonnes of Canadian rapeseed in export business overnight for last half May/first half June shipment, trade sources said.", "labels": ["oilseed", "rapeseed"]}, {"id": "test/16434", "text": "IRVING BANK &lt;V> 1ST-QTR NET HURT BY BRAZIL Irving Bank Corp said a six pct drop in first-quarter net income from a year earlier was largely the result of placing medium- and long-term loans to borrowers in Brazil and Ecuador on non-accrual status.

While GAF did not win the company, it made a substantial gain on its investment in Carbide. Analysts said GAF already has a large profit built into its Borg-Warner holdings. They said even if GAF raises its offer and does not succeed, a higher bid from another company would give GAF millions of dollars in profits on its stock. \"It's a win-win situation,\" said one analyst. One analyst speculated an offer from GAF would be forthcoming shortly. \"I think we are finally down to the final paragraph in this book,\" he said. Borg-Warner's other businesses include automotive parts, protective services, which includes Wells Fargo security guards, and Chilton Corp, a credit rating service. Charles Rose, an Oppenheimer and Co analyst who follows GAF, said if GAF were to sell into the Merrill Lynch offer, it would realize about 125 mln dlrs net profit, or about 3.50 per share. \"I think there's a probability he goes up in price,\" said Rose. Rose said, however, he could not really predict what Heyman would do. \"Sam's a low-risk, high-return player.\" \"Is he trying to build a major industrial chemical enterprise, or is he trying to be an investment bank,\" Rose said. Analysts said Borg-Warner's chemical business would add earnings momentum to GAF. \"I worked out that paying as much as 50 dlrs per share would still be additive to GAF in time, if they sold off most of the non-chemical facilities,\" said John Henry of E.F. Hutton. Borg-Warner's chemical and plastics business provided 1986 operating profits of 153.3 mln dlrs on revenues of 1.04 billion dlrs. Total operating profits were 349.7 mln dlrs, and net earnings were 206.3 mln dlrs for 1986. \"The Borg chemical business is great,\" said Rose, adding its only U.S. competitors are Monsanto Co &lt;MCT> and Dow Chemical Co &lt;DOW>.", "labels": ["acq"]}, {"id": "test/16518", "text": "PUEBLO INTERNATIONAL INC &lt;PII> SETS PAYOUT Qtly div five cts vs five cts prior Pay June Two Record April 27", "labels": ["earn"]}, {"id": "test/16519", "text": "SWIFT &lt;SFTPF> TO SELL SOUTH DAKOTA PORK PLANT Swift Independent Packing Co said it agreed in principle to sell its Huron, South Dakota pork plant to Huron Dressed Beef, for undisclosed terms.

But the officials said they expect the EC to allow U.S. plants to continue shipping meat through the end of the year provided they submit a plant improvement program with the U.S. Agriculture Department. The EC's so-called Third Country Meat Directive will require foreign meat processing plants to comply fully with EC inspection standards beginning April 30. The U.S. meat industry has prepared a petition requesting the Reagan administration to retaliate against the EC rule. At issue are U.S. meat exports to the EC valued at 132 mln dlrs in 1985. The EC rule would require all U.S. plants to make changes in their inspection methods, ranging from veterinary staffing to use of wood. Last December, the EC determined that only one U.S. cattle, one hog and one sheep slaughtering facility could be approved without further review. USDA would have to certify that the plants had corrected the deficiencies. All remaining plants with a history or potential of shipping to the EC -- totaling nearly 400 -- would require more significant changes in plant constructions or procedures before further EC review. Robert Hibbert, general counsel for the American Meat Institute, said the meat industry expected to submit a formal trade retaliation petition by April 30. An interagency committee is reviewing the industry's draft petition. An official at the U.S. Trade Representative's Office said U.S. officials continued to press the EC to withdraw the rule, but that \"the chances of that are not too good at this time.\" However, there is the \"expectation\" in U.S. government and meat industry circles that the EC will continue to allow shipments, at least through the end of the calendar year, from U.S. plants that submit to USDA a plan on how they will bring their operations into conformity with the EC regulation, the USTR official said.", "labels": ["carcass", "livestock"]}, {"id": "test/16565", "text": "U.S. BANKS LIKELY TO LIFT PRIME RATES AGAIN SOON Major U.S. banks may lift prime lending rates again within days due to recent increases in their borrowing costs and speculation the Federal Reserve is nudging up interest rates to help the dollar, economists said. In what was the first prime rate boost since mid-1984, most banks in early April lifted their rates a quarter point to 7-3/4 pct, citing a reduced gap between the prime and their own cost of money. That spread has narrowed again. \"A prime rate increase could happen as soon as tonight,\" said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International Inc. Brusca said a quarter-point prime rate rise to eight pct is justified because the spread between banks' cost of funds and the prime rate has narrowed to less than three quarters of a percentage point. He said that spread had averaged around 1.4 percentage points since last October until it fell below one point and triggered the April prime rate rise at most banks. \"We could easily have another prime rate increase as soon as this week,\" said David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston and Co. \"We've got a fairly good chance of a prime rate rise in the near future,\" said Allan Leslie of Discount Corp. \"Based on the spread between the prime rate and funding costs, you would ordinarily see a prime rate increase now,\" said Harold Nathan, economist at Wells Fargo Bank. However, he said banks may be reluctant to lift the prime because that would dampen already fairly weak business loan demand and because some are not sure the Fed will maintain recent upward pressure on money market interest rates. Nathan believes the Fed has let market pressures lift short-term rates in recent days to help the ailing dollar. He said \"if there is widespread belief money market rates will stay high, a prime rate rise could occur at any time.\" Fed officials have long expressed concern that too steep a dollar drop could help rekindle U.S. inflation. As the dollar fell to a 40-year low against the yen Friday, currency traders said the Fed and other central banks supported the dollar. In addition to buying dollars outright, another way to stabilize the U.S. currency would be for the Fed to push U.S. interest rates higher relative to overseas rates. Based particularly on the Fed's reserve management actions on Friday and today, Nathan of Wells Fargo said \"it has become clear that the Fed is not fully resisting upward rate pressure in the market. It is supplying fewer reserves than are needed.\" Bank funding costs and other short and long-term interest rates rose sharply Friday and today on heightened speculation that the Fed is gently firming monetary policy. That was because the Fed supplied far fewer reserves in the market than most economists had expected. On Friday, the Fed added reserves indirectly and in small amounts via one billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements with the Federal funds rate at which banks lend to one another high at 6-5/16 pct. With funds trading even higher at 6-1/2 pct today, the Fed arranged only a slightly larger 1.5 billion dlr round of customer repurchase agreements. \"The Fed's actions on Friday and today show that it is offering only token resistance to upward funds rate pressures,\" said Jones of Lanston. \"The Fed is focusing its policy attention mainly on the need to defend the dollar,\" Jones said. He believes it is merely shading policy toward restraint now, \"but to have a major impact on the dollar, the Fed will have to tighten policy overtly at some point.\" Jones expects the Fed to foster higher market rates by becoming more restrictive in supplying reserves and, within four to six weeks, to raise its discount rate from 5-1/2 pct. Jones said a U.S. discount rate increase to six pct might well be accompanied by West German and Japanese rate cuts to further aid the dollar. Given likely Fed policy firming, he said both the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds (about 8.30 pct now) and the prime rate may be at 8-1/2 pct at end-June and nine pct by year's end. \"The jury is still out on whether the Fed is tightening policy to defend the dollar,\" said Leslie of Discount Corp.

Today's ITC ruling was consistent with the Commerce Department's final ruling of March 9, and activates an anti-dumping duty of 1.96 pct on imports of Brazilian frozen concentrated orange juice, Stephen Vastagh, ITC investigator said. The ITC found that Brazilian orange juice imports have injured U.S. producers. The Commerce Department had already ruled that the imports were unfairly priced, and lowered to 1.96 pct the anti-dumping margin that in a preliminary decision last fall had been set at 8.5 pct, Vastagh said. The U.S. government has been requiring bond to be posted on imports of Brazilian frozen concentrated orange juice since Commerce's preliminary ruling of last October 23, he said. Commerce had ruled that one major Brazilian producer -- Cutrale -- would be excluded from the anti-dumping duty. Brazilian imports account for about 40 pct of total U.S. supply, Vastagh said. Between December 1985 and November 1986, the United States imported the equivalent of 546 mln gallons of Brazilian orange juice worth 622 mln dlrs, he said. Currently, the United States requires a 35-cent per gallon tariff on orange juice imports, Vastagh said. An ITC spokesman said the agency would forward its final report on the anti-dumping case to Commerce by April 22. Commerce then will process the anti-dumping order and transmit it to U.S Customs, which will liquidate bond entries dating from Commerce's preliminary ruling and begin assessing duties, Vastagh said.

The severe conditions with suppliers and creditors arose from an unfavorable ruling last Monday by the U.S. Supreme Court in Texaco's ongoing dispute with Pennzoil Co &lt;PZL> over the acquisition of Getty Oil Co in 1984. The High Court said Texas Courts must consider Texaco's plea to cut its 10.3 billion dlr bond while appealing the case. \"Most of the suppliers stayed with us as long as they could,\" Elton said. But following Monday's Supreme Court ruling, Texaco's suppliers began demanding cash and halting supplies. \"It wasn't until last Wednesday that it turned into an avalanche,\" he said. \"Supplies were cut to the point where we could not run the system at anywhere near capacity.\" He said less than half of Texaco's oil supplies had been in jeapordy, but the cut off would have produced severe shortages by mid-May. Now the situation appears much less severe, Elton said. It said that Sonatrach, the Algerian national oil company, canceled future deliveries of crude oil and natural gas, Occidental Petroleum Co &lt;OXY> demanded cash for crude, and Atlantic Richfield Co &lt;ARC> asked for special safeguards.

Dome rose 1/4 to 1-1/8 on the American Stock Exchange and gained 31 cents to 1.44 Canadian dlrs on the Toronto Stock Exchange, where it was the most active stock. It rose as high as 1.50 dlrs in Toronto during the day. In recent months, Dome has normally moved by only a few cents per day. TransCanada PipeLines yesterday announced a 4.3 billion dlr Canadian (3.22 billion U.S.) bid for all of Dome's assets, but Dome, which is based in Calgary, Alberta, said it is also still talking with two other companies, which it refuses to identify. Market analysts today said the other two firms are believed to be foreign oil companies, noting that TransCanada yesterday stressed that its bid is \"a Canadian solution to the financial difficulties of Dome Petroleum.\" \"The talk is about Conoco, which is controlled by DuPont &lt;DD>, and Atlantic Richfield Co &lt;ARC>, which sold its Canadian interest in 1975 and could be getting back in,\" said Wilf Gobert of Peters and Co Ltd. David Bryson of Moss Lawson and Co also noted that British Petroleum PLC &lt;BP> is mentioned as a possible buyer, despite BP's 70 U.S. dlr per share bid two weeks ago for the 45 percent of Standard Oil Co &lt;SRD> it does not already own. Calgary-based independent analyst James Hamilton has said in recent reports that Amoco Corp &lt;AN> has also been in talks with Dome. Representatives of Atlantic Richfield, British Petroleum, Conoco and Amoco were not immediately available for comment. Gobert characterized the market action in Dome today as \"awfully optimistic,\" given TransCanada's offer to give current Dome shareholders stock in a new subsidiary, which it valued at 1.10 dlrs Canadian per common share. Under the offer, current Dome common and preferred shareholders would own 20 pct of the new subsidiary, which would own and operate all Dome's former assets. TransCanada would own 80 pct. However, Bryson said the market may be looking at the potential for shares in a publicly-traded subsidiary. \"The TransCanada offer has quite a bit of upside potential for Dome,\" he said. Gobert said he believes the TransCanada offer is \"at the upper end of what I thought somebody would pay for Dome.\" The TransCanada proposal would pay Dome's creditors 3.87 billion Canadian dlrs (2.90 billion U.S. dlrs), with another one billion Canadian dlrs (750 mln U.S. dlrs) available to secured creditors if the Dome subsidiary earns profits above a certain level. TransCanada would not detail the profit level. Dome currently is seeking to restructure about six billion Canadian dlrs (4.5 billion U.S. dlrs) in debt, which it took on several years ago when oil prices were high and the company wanted to expand. \"There has been speculation that Dome's assets are capable of supporting debt of three to four billion dlrs, so on that basis, the TransCanada offer would be at the upper end of that,\" Gobert said. Dome's debt troubles have often obscured the fact that it is a major player in the Canadian oil and gas field. It holds reserves of about 176 mln barrels of crude oil and 3.9 billion cubic feet of natural gas. The company also owns or has an interest in 14.2 mln acres of oil and gas exploration land in the province of Alberta, the heart of Canada's oil industry. Dome owns or has an interest in a total of 36.1 mln acres of land across Canada. The company also has tax credits of about 2.5 billion dlrs Canadian (1.9 billion dlrs U.S.).

In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Merrill Lynch Capital Partners Inc said it would receive a 30 mln dlr fee from the surviving company for acting as dealer manager of the merger after the Borg-Warner deal is completed. But it said it could also receive a break-up fee of 30 mln dlrs if the deal fails for reasons, which include another party holding more than 40 pct of its stock or tendering for 50 pct. The 30 mln dlr fee is among the highest set down in any tender offer agreement, either in compensation for dealer manager services or for break-up of the deal. Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, backed by a group of investors it organized, has launched a 48.50 dlr a share tender offer for Borg-Warner for 90 pct of its stock. The company's board has approved the plan, which was intended to thwart an unsolicited offer from GAF Corp. Borg-Warner also agreed to redeem all outstanding Series A preferred shares and to pay off on all options at a 48.50 dlr a share exercise price before the merger is effective, it said. Merrill Lynch said its representatives discussed a possible leveraged buyout with Borg-Warner as early as last December. At that time, Merrill Lynch told the company it would consider a 43 dlr a share tender offer in cash and securities, if the Borg-Warner board approved, it said. On Feb 24, it said it was told the company had decided against a buyout. But talks were revived after GAF launched its 46 dlr a share proposal on March 31, Merrill Lynch said. Unlike its earlier proposal, Merrill Lynch said Borg-Warner management was asked not to take part in the new deal and it was conditioned upon payment of the fees. In addition to its fees, Merrill Lynch said it will also get up to 17 mln dlrs from Borg-Warner to cover its expenses in the tender offer. Merrill Lynch said it would continue operating Borg-Warner as a subsidiary with its current officers keeping their positions. But for flexibility purposes, Merrill Lynch said it is considering redistributing Borg-Warner's assets to a number of subsdiaries of an entity it created to carry out the merger. All in all Merrill Lynch estimated that there would be 130 mln dlrs in fees and expenses connected with the deal. Another 250 mln dlrs will be needed to repay certain debt of Borg-Warner, Merrill Lynch said. To finance the deal, Merrill Lynch said it expects to borrow 3.5 billion dlrs from a group of banks and sell 100 mln dlrs of common stock of the new company, sell 100 mln dlrs of non-voting preferred stock of the new company to Merrill Lynch and Co, sell up to 650 mln dlrs of subordinated notes to Merrill Lynch and Co and sell to the public 204 mln dlrs of subordinated discount debentures.

Kim told reporters the excessively fast rise in exports could make South Korea too reliant on exports, increase nflation and produce trade friction. The policy shift, which means abandoning Seoul's goal of rapidly reducing its foreign debt, was worked out at a series of ministerial meetings. Kim, who is also Economic Planning Minister, said the current account surplus, previously expected to exceed eight billion dlrs this year, would be held at about five billion dlrs by increasing imports, accelerating market liberalisation and rationalising exports. He said Seoul would try to limit its current account surplus to around five billion dlrs a year for the next few years, although trade volume would continue to grow. \"This will gradually reduce the ratio of the surplus to GNP (gross national product) from the current five pct level to three pct by 1991,\" he added. Koo Bon-yong, an aide to Kim, said South Korea's foreign debt had been expected to fall below 40 billion dlrs by the end of 1987, against the initial forecast of 41.8 billion, and 44.5 billion dlrs at end-1986. \"But now (with the policy changes) the debt is expected to remain above 40 billion dlrs, although it could still be lower than the originally projected 41.8 billion dlrs,\" he said. The policy change was announced two days before the scheduled arrival of U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige for talks with Trade Minister Rha Woong-bae. South Korea is under U.S. Pressure to reduce its bilateral trade surplus, which rose to 7.4 billion dlrs last year from 4.3 billion dlrs in 1985.

The farm sector, which is protected by import tariffs and quotas, propped up by subsidies and price supports, and sheltered by the tax system, has ample room for change, they said. \"In economic terms, reform would be a plus,\" said Christopher Chew of brokerage firm James Capel and Co. The ultimate cost of the existing system is food prices twice those in Europe and two to three times those in the U.S., The analysts said. Spending on food accounts for about one quarter of the average household's budget and roughly 10 pct of the gross national product (GNP), according to a study by Chew. Reducing these prices could increase household spending power by five pct, his study said. The money could be spent on products which would have a more direct impact in boosting domestic growth, it added. \"There's a lot of slack,\" a U.S. Government official in Tokyo said. \"All that money could be spent on something else.\" Direct central government subsidies to the farm sector amount to some five billion dlrs per year. Independent estimates put total subsidies from all sources as high as 37 billion and the analysts said much of that money is wasted. Changing tax laws to encourage city residents who only farm on weekends to put their land up for sale for residential development would also give a boost to domestic spending, economists said. \"Housing construction is the key strategic variable in the expansion of domestic demand,\" wrote Chihiro Nakajima, professor at Kyoto Gakuen University. Japanese business groups are calling for staged farm reform to shift some of the burden of trade friction and economic restructuring away from the manufacturing sector and onto the farm sector. Employers groups also want change. \"If you really want to expand domestic demand, the way to do it is not to raise wages recklessly, but to reduce commodity prices,\" Bumpei Otsuki, President of the Japan Federation of Employers' Associations told a recent press conference. External pressures are rising as the U.S. And Europe seek removal of tariffs and quotas to help reduce their trade deficits with Japan. But vested Japanese interests opposed to change remain well entrenched, dimming prospects for quick reform, analysts said. Although the full-time farm population is falling and there are signs the LDP is paying more attention to urban constituencies, the ruling party remains heavily dependent on farm votes in the rural areas. One rural vote is worth several city votes due to the pattern of constituency borders. The LDP is already in political trouble over its tax reform plan and does not want to raise another sticky issue so soon, the analysts said. Consumer groups are politically weak and tend to accept the traditional view that higher prices are a small fee to pay for national food security, they said. Powerful agricultural cooperatives are fiercely opposed to import liberalisation, but are more flexible about reforms aimed at stepping up productivity, they said.

Lyng plans to ask Japan to open the door to rice imports by partially lifting the longstanding ban on foreign purchases. A private U.S. Rice trader visited Tokyo last week requesting Japan buy 200,000 tonnes of rice for industrial uses such as making sake. Japan has rejected the overture, saying Tokyo maintains a policy of self-sufficiency in rice. Lyng will also press Japan to eliminate an import quota for beef by April 1988 because he believes Japanese consumers would like to buy much more beef than currently allowed. He cited the example of a California company which transports live U.S. Cattle to Japan by air for slaughter to circumvent the beef quota. The cost of transport is higher than the value of the animal, he said. U.S. Officials said the Japan Livestock Industry Promotion Corporation which regulates beef imports, was forced to borrow from the fiscal 1987 quota earlier this year because the 1986 quota was exhausted and Japanese beef prices were rising. Japan has said it cannot open its markets to beef imports. Along with beef, the U.S. Will also press Japan to eliminate import quotas on fresh oranges and orange juice by April, 1988. Some U.S. Officials believe Japan may eventually be willing to scrap the quota on fresh oranges because liberalized trade would not necessarily damage the Japanese mandarin orange industry.

Hideo Maki, Director General of the ministry's Economic Affairs Bureau, quoted Lyng as telling Agriculture Minister Mutsuki Kato that the removal of import restrictions would help Japan as well as the United States. The meeting with Kato opened a 12-day visit to Japan by Lyng, who is here to dicuss farm trade. However, Maki quoted Kato as replying that Japan was already the world's largest grain importer. Kato added Japan is the largest customer for U.S. Grain and depended on domestic output for only 53 pct of its food requirements in 1985. Lyng said the U.S. Put high priority on talks on 12 farm products named in U.S. Complaints against Japan to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) last year, as well as on beef, citrus products and rice. Kato said Japan will maintain its current level of self-sufficiency and will try not to produce surplus rice because potential production is higher than domestic demand. The world farm market suffers from surpluses because of rising production by exporting countries, he added. Lyng said the U.S. Has been trying to reduce farm product output with expensive programs, Maki said.

The 100 pct tariffs are to be imposed on 300 mln dlrs of Japanese goods recommended for curbs by a special panel of experts headed by the U.S. Trade Representative's Office. Reagan announced last March 27 he would impose the tariffs on certain goods taken from a list that ranged from computors and television sets to power tools and photographic film. The panel this week winnowed through the list of the some 20 products and sent their recommendations yesterday to Santa Barbara, where Reagan is vacationing. In his March annoucement, Reagan said \"I am committed to full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to provide American industry with free and fair trade opportunities.\" He added the tariffs would be lifted once Japan honored the pact it signed last year to end dumping semiconductors in world markets and opened its home market to U.S. products. U.S. officials said Japan had done nothing since the March announcement to alter Reagan's plan to invoke the sanctions. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said yesterday: \"we do not want a trade war, but we feel that this is the kind of action that requires meaningful action.\" Reagan's move follows steadily rising U.S. trade deicits, with last year's hitting a record $169.8 billion. About one-third of the deficit is in trade with Japan. Congress is weighing a trade bill to force the president to retaliate in certain cases of unfair trade practices. He has opposed the legislation, saying it would prevent negotiated solutions to trade disputes and, in any case, that existing law was adqeuate to end unfair trade practices. Trade experts say his tough action against the Japanese was as much to penalize the Japanese as to show Congress he did not need any new trade legislation. The Japanese have complained that they have been honoring the semiconductor pact, but that it would take time before the results showed up. U.S. officials, however, have said their monitoring of Japanese semiconductor shipments to East Asian countries and Western Europe showed no letup in the dumping and that the Japanese home markets remained shut to American exports. Japan has said that if Reagan imposed the tariffs, it would file a complaint with the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade (GATT). It said hoped GATT would find the U.S. retaliation had violated the regulations of the global trading group and would approve compensation or Japanese retaliation. U.S. officials have said they did not think Japan would retaliate because it had too much to lose in any trade war with the United States.", "labels": ["trade"]}, {"id": "test/16795", "text": "UNION PLANTERS CORP &lt;UPCM.O> 1ST QTR NET Shr 92 cts vs 1.16 dlrs Qtly div 10 cts vs 10 cts prior Net 5,700,000 vs 5,400,000 Avg shrs 6,100,000 vs 3,700,000 NOTE: Dividend pay May 15, record May One.", "labels": ["earn"]}, {"id": "test/16796", "text": "UNION PLANTERS &lt;UPCM.O> ACQUISITIONS APPROVED Union Planters Corp said it has received regulatory approvals for its previously-announced acquisitions of Borc Financial Corp and First Citizens Bank of Hohenwald, and approval of its acquisition of Merchants State Holding Co is expected within 10 days.

No financial details about the Amoco offer were available and a Dome spokesman would neither confirm nor deny that Amoco had emerged the winner, the newspaper said. However, the Dome spokesman indicated that the sale of Dome could be finalized and announced this weekend, the Globe and Mail said. Representatives of Amoco were not immediately available for comment. Last Sunday, when TransCanada announced its offer, Dome said it was also in talks with two other companies, but refused to identify them.

British Petroleum PLC &lt;BP> and Royal Dutch/Shell Group &lt;RD> have also been mentioned as possible suitors for Dome. In the past two days, Dome management has been pressured by the federal government to select the offer from TransCanada, the only Canadian company in the bidding. Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's government appears to want to avoid a Dome sale to a foreign company since the government gave Dome hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks to encourage oil and gas exploration in the Arctic, analysts and officials have said. A purchase by TransCanada would be least likely to run afoul of Canadian antitrust laws, however, TransCanada is asking for tax concessions from a federal government that is trying to hold its deficit below 30 billion Canadian dlrs, analysts have said. A takeover by Amoco or Imperial would also give a foreign oil company a dominant position in Canada's oil industry. Imperial Oil is already Canada's largest energy company, with 1986 revenues of 7.1 billion Canadian dlrs. Chicago-based Amoco had 1986 revenues of 20.23 billion U.S. dlrs.

Asked in a television interview what the chance was for Reagan to cancel the scheduled 100 pct tariffs on Japanese electronic exports, he said \"slim to none.\" Reagan announced on March 27 he would impose the tariffs to retaliate for Japan's failure to honor a 1986 agreement to end dumping computer semiconductors in world markets at less than cost and to open its home markets to U.S. products. Yeutter, on the NBC program \"Today,\" said the United States did not want to terminate the agreement and would drop the tariffs once Japan began fulfilling the agreement. He said Japanese negotiators last week told U.S. officials they were honoring the pact, but Yeutter said it would take time to monitor any compliance. Asked how long that would take, he said \"We want to see a pattern of compliance, so in a minimum I would say that would take a few weeks.\" Yeutter said he did not think there would be much consumer impact by the tariffs on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese goods because the items selected are also readily available from other countries and manufacturers.

The department is required by law to wait 48 hours after the initial trade report to issue a second report on a \"customs value\" basis, which eliminates the freight and insurance charges from the cost of imports. Private-sector economists emphasized that the Commerce Department was not revising down the deficit by 1.45 billion dlrs but simply presenting the figures on a different basis. A report in the Washington Post caused a stir in the foreign exchanges today because it gave the impression, dealers said, that the underlying trade deficit for February had been revised downward. The Commerce department would like to have the law changed to permit it to report both sets of figures simultaneously. \"My feeling is the second one is a better report but there's legislation that requires us to delay it two days,\" said Robert Ortner, Commerce undersecretary for economic affairs. \"But this has been going on for a long time and no one pays any attention to the second figure.\" The 15.1 billion dlr February trade deficit compared with a revised January deficit of 12.3 billion dlrs.

But Robert Crandall, a trade specialist at Brookings Institution, a think tank, said \"a shot across their bow can often result in a shot in our stern.\" He said it left the United States open to retaliation. The U.S. officials said the 100 pct tariffs Reagan ordered on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese goods will also show Congress that a tough pro-trade stand can be taken under existing laws, and no new protectionist legislation is needed. In the past year tough trade action had been taken against the European Community over corn and sorghum, Taiwan over beer and wine, South Korea over counterfeiting of copyrights, patents and trademarkets and Japan on tobacco. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters the tariffs - up from five pct - should be seen as a \"serious signal\" to other nations on the need for fair trade practices. Reagan said he imposed the sanctions on certain computers, television sets and some hand tools because Japan did not honor an agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at less than cost and to open its markets to U.S. products. The tariffs were placed on items which were available from other sources so there would be little effect on the American consumer, Fitzwater said. Reagan has come under heavy pressure to take tougher action - especially against Japan - to end global unfair trade practices and reverse the growing U.S. trade deficit. The alternative was that if he did not, Congress would. The U.S. trade gap last year was a record 169.8 billion dlrs, and continues to rise, with Japan accounting for about one-third of America's overall deficit. But there are other two-way deficits - with Canada, West Germany, Taiwan and South Korea - and Reagan officials said the president is ready to fight them all. Reagan said in announcing the sanctions today that \"I regret that these actions are necessary,\" but that the health and vitality of the U.S. semiconductor industry was essential to American competitiveness in world markets. \"We cannot allow it to be jeopardized by unfair trading practices,\" Reagan added in the statement from his California vacation home at Santa Barbara. He said the tariffs would remain in force until Japan abided by the agreement. U.S. officials say the action today will show Congress - which is about to write a trade bill he does not like - that he already has the tools needed to fight unfair trade. The White House aide said of the tariff action, \"it wasn't done to appease Congress, but because there was an unfair trade practice.\" The aide added, however, \"on another plane, it was an example of how the administration uses the trade law to fight unfair practices, an that it is not necessary to make a major overall of our trade laws.\" But the analyst, Crandall, said the tariff action was not in the best interests of the United States, and that negotiations should have been pursued to resolve the issue. \"It's very dangerous to go down the retaliatory route,\" he said, \"because it leads to more retaliation and restrictions in trade.\" Crandall said, \"the administration is doing this for its political impact across the country, and therefore its impact on Congress.\" He said, \"I don't think it makes a lot of sense.\" But other analysts said it made little difference whether the tariffs were aimed at U.S. trading partners or Congress, and that the main point was that the trading partners were on notice that retaliation was a weapon Reagan was ready to use. Spokesman Fitzwater said \"we don't want a trade war,\" but the imposition of sanctions showed the United States would act when it had evidence that trade pacts were being violated.

Discount window borrowings, net free reserves, the Fed funds rate average and the pattern of reserve additions are all consistent with a modest tightening,\" said Dana Johnson of First Chicago Corp. Johnson, and several other economists, now estimate that the Fed funds rate should trade between 6-1/4 and 6-3/8 pct. Discount window borrowings in the week to Wednesday were 935 mln dlrs a day, producing a daily average for the two-week statement period of 689 mln dlrs, the highest since the week of December 31, 1986, and up from 393 mln dlrs previously. Moreover, banks were forced to borrow a huge 5.2 billion dlrs from the Fed on Wednesday - the highest daily total this year - even though unexpectedly low Treasury balances at the Fed that day left banks with over two billion dlrs more in reserves than the Fed had anticipated. However, economists said it is almost certain that the Fed is aiming for much lower discount window borrowings than witnessed this week. They pointed to two factors that may have forced banks to scramble for reserves at the end of the week. First, economists now expect M-1 money supply for the week ended April 29 to rise by a staggering 15 to 20 billion dlrs, partly reflecting the parking in checking accounts of the proceeds from stock market sales and mutual fund redemptions to pay annual income taxes. As banks' checking-account liabilities rise, so do the reserves that they are required to hold on deposit at the Fed. Required reserves did indeed rise sharply by 2.5 billion dlrs a day in the two weeks ended Wednesday, but economists said the Fed may not have believed in the magnitude of the projected M-1 surge until late in the week and so started to add reserves too late. Second, an apparent shortage of Treasury bills apparently left Wall Street dealers with too little collateral with which to enagage in repurchase agreements with the Fed, economists said. Thus, although there were 10.3 billion dlrs of repos outstanding on Wednesday night, the Fed may have wanted to add even more reserves but was prevented from doing so. \"It's not at all inconceivable that the Fed didn't add as much as they wanted to because of the shortage of collateral,\" said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Economics Inc. McCarthy estimated that the Fed is now targetting discount-window borrowings of about 400 mln dlrs a day, equivalent to a Fed funds rate of around 6-3/8 pct. After citing the reasons why the Fed probably has not tightened credit to the degree suggested by the data, economists said the fact that the Fed delayed arranging overnight injections of reserves until the last day of the statement period was a good sign of a more restrictive policy. Jeffrey Leeds of Chemical Bank had not been convinced that the Fed was tightening policy. But after reviewing today's figures, he said, \"It's fair to say that the Fed may be moving toward a slightly less accommodative reserve posture.\" Leeds expects Fed funds to trade between 6-1/4 and 6-3/8 pct and said the Fed is unlikely to raise the discount rate unless the dollar's fall gathers pace. Johnson at First Chicago agreed, citing political opposition in Washington to a dollar-defense package at a time when Congress sees further dollar depreciation as the key to reducing the U.S. trade surplus with Japan.", "labels": ["money-supply"]}, {"id": "test/17037", "text": "RORER GROUP INC &lt;ROR> 1ST QTR NET Oper shr profit 34 cts vs loss 78 cts Oper net profit 7,434,000 vs loss 17.0 mln Revs 201.2 mln vs 171.7 mln Note: Year-ago oper exludes gain on sale of businesses of 139.6 mln.

In fact, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) report said, such protectionist policies could make U.S. Products less competitive in the world marketplace by raising the cost of imported products that are re-exported in different forms. \"Such policies are much more likely to hurt, rather than help, the productive capabilities of the U.S. Economy,\" it said. The 218-page report, written by FTC economists John Hilke and Philip Nelson, blamed the rising trade shortfall, which climbed to a record 166.3 billion dlrs last year, on shifting currency exchange rates and growing U.S consumer demand. Other factors commonly blamed for the deficit, such as foreign trade practices, deteriorating U.S. Industrial competitiveness, high labour costs and government restrictions on mergers, added little to the problem, it said. \"Although each industry's competitiveness affects the level of imports and exports in that industry, in general we find that there have been no significant industry-specific changes affecting competitiveness that would explain the increase in the overall trade deficit,\" the study said. \"To the extent any government action is needed to deal with the trade deficits, policies should focus on economy-wide phenomena such as exchange rates and relative economic growth,\" the FTC study said. Supporting its conclusion that broad-based economic shifts were the cause of the increase in the trade deficit, the report said it found that nearly all U.S. Industries lost some domestic market share to foreign competitors in the 1980s. It also said it found a \"fairly direct relationship\" between the increased trade deficit and the influence of shifting currency exchange rates, U.S. Economic growth and domestic demand for goods and services, which has outpaced foreign consumer demand. The study examined seven factors which have been commonly blamed for the trade deficit: foreign government subsidies and trade barriers to protect foreign industries, a lack of investment in U.S. Industry, declining research and development in U.S. Industry, high labour costs, union work rules, the oil prices rises of the 1970s and U.S. Antitrust regulations.

He said he did not know how much support the levy had within the EC but he said he believed those originally opposed to the tax were under pressure to change their position. Romero said a group of EC members led by West Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark and Norway were opposed to the tax. But there was a danger some of them would be persuaded to change sides, and if that happened opposition could crumble. Romero said another threat to exports lay in an EC warning that copra meal cake used in livestock feeds contained dangerous levels of aflatoxin, a carcinogenic chemical. He said the EC standard of 0.02 parts of aflatoxin per million parts of meal, which EC countries had been asked to apply by October 1988, was too rigid. He said Philippine copra cake contained much higher levels of aflatoxin. Aflatoxin comes from moulds which develop in copra when it is not properly dried or ground. Romero said he would tell big buyers of copra meal in London that the Philippines was doing its best to meet EC standards. It was also trying to eliminate aflatoxin totally, but this was likely to take several years of research. Copra meal exports were 817,641 tonnes or 35 pct of total coconut exports in 1986. The meal was worth 73.5 mln dlrs. Romero said he would also visit Oxford University's department of agricultural economics to discuss ways of avoiding the copra process altogether. \"There are ways of producing coconut products outside of copra,\" Romero said. \"We can process fresh coconut without drying the meat in the sun. Through the wet process we can process coconuts into other food or non-food products, or we can go to the chemical root.\" He said there was a tendency for agricultural countries to become more protectionist and he expected export prices of coconut products to drop. \"In the long term we will be getting less and less for more and more production, and I'm not comfortable with that,\" he said. With countries like Indonesia and Malaysia stepping up production of palm oil, a coconut oil substitute, palm oil output had risen nearly 70 pct since 1971, Romero said. \"To add to that the U.S. Soybean Association is spending billions of dollars to discredit palm oil and coconut oil by saying that they are polysaturated fats and bad for the heart,\" he said. Romero said he expected coconut product export prices to stay up for the rest of the year. They would probably touch a high of 20 cents/pound from the current level of 18.59 cents, and a sharp rise from year-ago levels of 10.50 cents. Romero said the Philippines was at the end of a five-year coconut production cycle which showed production tended to fall after two successive years of good harvests. He said 1985 and 1986 were good harvests and this year, to add to the production fall, drought had affected output. \"Traders are stocking up and when they have overbought the prices will start declining again. The only sure way to keep prices stable is by processing, adding more value,\" he said. Coconut farmers were being encouraged to intercrop by planting other cash crops between coconut trees, he said. \"A typical farm may have from 100 to 150 trees sitting on 10,000 square metres of land. That's a lot of space,\" Romero said. He said the government's proposed land reform program would exclude about 75 pct of the coconut farmers because they had less than the proposed seven-hectares of land. \"If the idea of land reform is to increase income levels, production and employment then it won't happen,\" he said.

Adrian Lajous, Pemex' executive vice president of international trade, said current OPEC output already appeared to be very near the 16.6 mln barrel per day level it set itself for the third quarter. \"Production is surging ahead of what was originally planned, while demand is growing more slowly than envisaged a few months ago,\" he said.

Despite this buying, the price of cocoa is well under the 1,600 Special Drawing Rights, SDRs, a tonne level below which the bsm is obliged to buy cocoa off the market. \"Even before he started operations, traders estimated the manager would need to buy at least up to his 75,000 tonnes maximum before prices moved up to or above the 1,600 SDR level, and yet he appears reluctant to do so,\" one manufacturer said. \"We all hoped the manager would move into the market to buy up to 75,000 tonnes in a fairly short period, and then simply step back,\" he added. \"The way the manager is only nibbling at the edge of the market at the moment is actually depressing sentiment and the market because everyone is holding back from both buying and selling waiting to see what the manager will do next,\" one processor said. \"As long as his buying tactics remain the same the market is likely to stay in the doldrums, and I see no indication he is about to alter his methods,\" he added.

The Cereals Intervention Board, ONIC, Wheat Producers' Association and the National Union of Agricultural and Cereal Cooperatives have not yet forecast 1987/88 exports or end-of-season stocks. However, the officials said the USDA's figure of end 1987/88 stocks at 5.03 mln tonnes against 1986/87's 2.87 mln was not surprising given a record high yield forecast in April. The French Feed Cereals Research Institute, ITCF, forecast in mid-April an average yield of 6.58 tonnes per hectare for soft wheat in 1987/88 compared with 5.6 tonnes in 1986/87 and the record high yield of 6.5/6.6 tonnes in 1984. This would result in a French soft wheat harvest of around 31 mln tonnes against 25.5 mln in 1986/87, given a Ministry of Agriculture estimate of area planted of 4.66 mln hectares against 4.61 mln in 1986/87. ONIC's first preliminary forecast of the 1987/88 campaign will be released at the beginning of September, an ONIC official said. Soft wheat exports in 1987/88 were extremely difficult to estimate at this stage, both within the European Community and to non-EC countries, an ONIC official said. He said, however, that among countries to which France could increase its wheat exports were Egypt and the Maghreb countries (Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia), he said. The USDA's forecast of an 11.65 mln tonne maize crop in 1987/88 against 11.48 mln in 1986/87, while again premature, was not out of line with estimates of the French Maize Producers Association, AGPM, an AGPM official said. Maize plantings would be down in 1987/88 but yields were expected to be higher, the AGPM official said.

But an overlifting by Texaco Inc in the first quarter allowed other companies like Exxon Corp to underlift its obligations under the contract PIW said that that one alternative under consideration is to revert to four individual contracts rather than a collective agrement. John Lichtblau, director of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation Inc said that renegotiation of the pact was more of a formality as the Saudis have each company on a separate schedule although separate agreements with the companies would favor one on one negotiations and ensure that contracted liftings occur . \"The companies will probably follow the Saudi wants within limits as they do not want to antagonize them for the long haul,\" he said.

The suit, filed in Manhattan, also names First Boston Corp &lt;FBC> and seeks to void the issue by Harcourt of 40,000 shares of super voting preferred stock to First Boston Securities Corp and the issue of convertible voting preferred stock with 4,700,000 votes in the Harcourt employee stock ownership plan. The preferred shares to be issued to First Boston have 8,160,000 votes. The suit, brought derivatively on behalf of Harcourt and individually in British Printing's capacity as a substantial holder of Harcourt common shares and 6-3/8 pct convertible debentures. The suit alleges Harcourt's special dividend exceeds by more than one billion dlrs Harcout's surplus available for dividends under New York law and contstitutes a fraudulent conveyance. The lawsuit also alleges that Harcourt failed to disclose that one consequence of the payment of the dividend, which it terms illegal, will be that shareholders will be liable to repay it. Harcourt last week said it would pay 40 dlrs per share to stockholders as a special dividend. Harcourt also announced an extensive recapitalization plan, which analysts said was aimed at thwarting a takeover effort by British Printing. British Printing last week withdrew its 44 dlr per share, or two billion dlr offer for Harcourt because of the recapitalizaton plan. At the time, it said it was reviewing its alternatives. British Printing said it filed the suit after consultation with its advisers. Its lawsuit also alleges that Harcourt failed to disclose the effect of the special dividend on Harcourt 6-3/8 pct convertible debentures. British Printing alleges the effect will be an enormous increase effective on the June eight record date for the dividend in the number of Harcourt common shares issuable upon conversion of the debentures. British Printing also charged Harcourt is unlawfully coercing debenture holders to convert denbentures before the record date because Harcourt may not have enough authorized common shares to honor conversion after the date. British Printing holds 460,600 shares and 5.6 mln dlrs worth of debentures. The suit also alleges that management, the board of directors, and First Boston engaged in an illegal scheme of entrenchment through a combination of selling to First Boston Securities Corp the super voting preferred at a bargain price, the grant to the company employee stock plan of convertible voting preferred, the six mln share open market repurchase program and the manner in which its financing has been structured.", "labels": ["acq"]}, {"id": "test/17576", "text": "STEINBERG GROUP HAS FIVE PCT OF PIZZA INN &lt;PZA> A group controlled by New York investor Saul Steinberg told the Securities and Exchange Commission it has acquired 168,500 shares of Pizza Inn Inc, or 5.02 pct of the total outstanding common stock.

At the same time, the banks would be expected to allow the ECGD to realise additional savings by refinancing existing government backed credit in the capital markets.

Speculation has been rife that the Dutch Central Bank, encouraged by a strong guilder/mark relationship and wide premiums for Dutch money and capital market rates over German, might lower rates without the Bundesbank moving first. Last month, the Central Bank lowered its special advances rate to 5.1 pct from 5.25 pct after the Bundesbank dropped its repurchase tender rate to 3.55 pct from 3.8 pct. That rate has remained in force, just holding above the five pct official secured loans rate which governs commercial bank borrowings. Given a strong guilder, a further fall in the West German repo rate would trigger a lower special advances tariff, forcing an official Dutch rate cut, analysts said. In February, when the Bundesbank cut its discount rate to three pct from 3.5 pct, the Central Bank only lowered money market rates and removed a surcharge over the secured loans rate on lending under its three month credit quota. Since then, however, both the Central Bank and Finance Ministry have made it clear they favour lower official rates. In April, Central Bank President Wim Duisenberg said he would follow any Bundesbank cut, and last week the Finance Ministry expressed satisfaction when it raised 2.25 billion guilders with a six pct coupon state loan priced at 100.10 pct for an effective yield of 5.98 pct, the lowest since 1965. Technically, analysts said, there has to be a difference between the secured loans rate which applies to lending under the credit quota, and the tariff on special advances which add extra liquidity to the money market. Bank economists and dealers said a West German move to further lower the rate on securities repurchase pacts would result in the Central Bank easing the special advance rate, provided the guilder/mark relationship permitted. The Central Bank aims to keep the guilder stable around its parity value within the European Monetary System of 112.673 guilders per 100 marks. Today, foreign exchange buying pushed the mark up 10 guilder cents to 112.705 guilders per 100 at the fix, a level that would not permit a change in the interest rate differential between West Germany and the Netherlands, dealers said. An economist at ABN Bank said he expected West German and Dutch interest rates to ease in the short term. However, he said new wage agreements in West Germany had raised inflation expectations which would put upward pressure on interest rates in the longer term. In the Netherlands, the inflation outlook for 1987 is nil, or even negative, while the latest official economic forecasts point to a falling rate of economic growth. \"It will depend on the outcome of collective wage agreement negotiations here whether there could be cost push inflation,\" the ABN economist said. He said Dutch money supply growth, which ran at 3.4 pct in January, could also contribute to some inflation. At Amro Bank, a leading analyst said inflation could run to two pct next year. The bank expects Dutch capital market rates, currently averaging around 6.1 pct, to stop easing in the second half of this year and stabilize around 5.6 pct. Analysts said an official rate cut could trigger a buying spree on the bond market which would bring yields down, probably only temporarily, while money rates could fall below five pct.

By changing the definition of subsidy under U.S. countervailing duty law, House of Representatives Bill 3 removes protection for companies that take advantage of widely used government programs, Zimmerman told a media briefing. \"Clearly, any industry to which Canadian governments grant rights to fish, mine, cut timber, or produce power could be vulnerable to a finding of a subsidy under this language,\" he said. The Canadian forest lobby's Zimmerman also said the House of Representative Bill would adopt a new way of measuring subsidies that would greatly increase the size of any countervailing duties that might be imposed on Canadian resource exports to the U.S. Under the bill, any difference between Canadian prices and U.S. or world market prices would constitute a subsidy, he said. Such a method would make Canadian resource industries vulnerable to similar penalties like a 15 pct export tax imposed last January on shipments of Canadian softwood lumber to the U.S., Zimmerman added. Canadian negotiators agreed to levy the new tax if a U.S. forest industry lobby would drop its request for a countervail duty on imports of Canadian softwood lumber. \"We represent the first victim of the move to price other countries' natural resources according to the U.S. system,\" Zimmerman said. \"If we're an example, than other resource industries had better watch out,\" he added.

Besides IBM, \"Computer Associates will be far and away the most powerful company in the field,\" added E.F. Hutton analyst Terence Quinn. That field is a segment of the market known as system utilities, or software packages that boost the productivity of a company's data processing facilities by increasing the speed, power and efficiency of large mainframe computers. The merger of Uccel and Computer Associates combines the two biggest systems utilities suppliers other than IBM. Analysts said the remaining players are mostly small firms that will find the competition much harder than in the past. For Computer Associates, the merger with Uccel caps a six-year acquisition campaign that has vaulted the Garden City, N.Y.-based company to the top of the software industry. When the deal is completed sometime in August, the company's revenues will exceed 450 mln dlrs, pushing it past Microsoft Corp &lt;MFST> as the world's largest independent software vendor. Computer Associates founder and chairman Charles B. Wang took the company public in 1981, and since then he has bought 15 companies and boosted annual sales from 18.5 mln to 309.3 mln dlrs for the year ended March 31. Liemandt took charge of Wyly, sold off its non-computer businesses and decided that it would focus solely on mainframe computer software. In 1984, the company was renamed Uccel Corp. Liemandt, who said he will leave the company after the merger is completed, also turned to acquisitions for growth. On the last day of 1986, Uccel completed the buyouts of six companies for a total of about 60 mln dlrs. For 1986, it earned 17.0 mln dlrs, or 1.01 dlrs a share, on sales of 141.5 mln dlrs. The agreement took industry analysts by surprise, largely because the companies had been such bitter rivals. Also, Dallas-based Uccel had engineered a strong comeback from the dark days of 1982, when, as Wyly Corp, it lost 7.7 mln dlrs, or 56 cts a share. At that time, Wyly owned a potpourri of 13 different businesses, only three of which were involved in computer software. In 1983, Walter Haefner, a Swiss financier and a major Wyly investor, lured Gregory J. Liemandt away from his job as chairman of General Electric Co's &lt;GE> computer services unit. Computer Associates' Wang and Uccel's Liemandt said at a news conference that the merger would give computer users a single source for a wide range of software products. In addition to system utilities, Computer Associates also sell products for microcomputers, while Uccel has made inroads in the applications software market, where analysts said it has been successful with accounting and banking systems. Wang said Computer Associates would continue to support and enhance both companies' product lines, but noted that the company will eventually weed out duplicate offerings. He said about 20 pct of the companies' products overlap. Analysts said the merger would dilute the holdings of current Computer Associates shareholders by about 10 pct. But they joined Wang in forecasting that the deal will not dilute Computer Associates' earnings for the current fiscal year. Quinn of E.F. Hutton said Wang has a proven track record of completing acquisitions without earnings dilution. Therefore, he said he would not change his 1988 earnings estimate of 1.05 dlrs a share. Wang said he would look closely at the combined operations of the two companies and cut duplication in sales, marketing and research and development. Analysts said Computer Associates paid a premium for Uccel. Based on Friday's closing price, the company will swap 47.50 dlrs worth of its stock for each Uccel share, which is nearly 33 times Uccel's 1987 estimated earnings of 1.45 dlrs a share. Stephen T. McClellan of Merrill Lynch Research said most software companies are currently valued at about 20 times per-share earnings. But the analyst said Uccel was worth the premium because of its earnings potential and customer base. Wang said Haefner, the Swiss investor, would hold about 25 pct of Computer Associates stock after the merger. He currently owns 58 pct of Uccel. The executive said the merger would not alter his target of maintaining sales and earnings growth of 30 pct to 35 pct. In addition, he said he expects no problems in having the deal cleared by the antitrust division of the U.S. Justice Department.

One trader said some West African producers are annoyed the Buffer Stock manager is not playing his part as required by the International Cocoa Pact to stabilise prices from current lows. So far, only 21,000 tonnes of second hand cocoa have been taken up for buffer stock purposes and this, traders noted, only on an intermittent basis. They noted the purchases, of 8,000 tonnes in the first week he bought and 13,000 in the second, are well short of the limitations of no more than 5,000 tonnes in one day and 20,000 in one week which the cocoa agreement places on him. The traders recently returned from West Africa say producers there are unhappy about the impact on cocoa prices so far, noting producing countries are part of the international cocoa pact and deserve the same treatment as consumers. London traders say terminal market prices would have to gain around 300 stg a tonne to take the ICCO 10-day average indicator to its 1,935 sdr per tonne midway point (or reference price).

The buffer stock manager may announce today he will be making purchases tomorrow, although under the rules of the agreement such action is not automatic, traders said. Complaints about the inaction of the buffer stock manager are not confined to West African producers, they observed. A Reuter report from Rotterdam quoted industry sources there saying Dutch cocoa processors also are unhappy with the intermittent buffer stock buying activities. In London, traders expressed surprise that no more than 21,000 tonnes cocoa has been bought so far against total potential purchases under the new agreement of 150,000 tonnes. Carryover holdings from the previous International Cocoa Agreement in the stock total 100,000 tonnes.

On May 5, COMEX eliminated price limits on the two contracts following each spot delivery in gold, silver, copper and aluminum futures after a review of its clearing operations, which were severely tested by a volatile market in silver futures at the end of April. COMEX announced Friday the lifting of all daily limits, effective today. Gold futures, which previously had a limit of 25 dlrs per ounce in most back months, were about 7.00 dlrs weaker in the nearby contracts amid thin volume conditions, traders said. Silver futures, previously limited at 50 cents in most back months, were trading about 30-40 cts weaker in the nearby contracts amid quiet trading today. During the last week of April, silver futures often traded at the daily allowable limit amid concerns about inflation, the dollar, and other factors. Traders rushed into the spot, or unlimited, contract to offset those moves, analysts said. As a result, O'Neill said, there was much confusion, many unmatched trades, and large losses for some traders. The COMEX fined four large firms a total of 100,000 dlrs for failure to resolve unmatched trades in a timely manner. Paul Cain, a vice president at Shearson Lehman Brothers, said the elimination of price limits will cut back on panic buying or selling and contribute to more orderly markets. O'Neill added that the elimination of daily limits would add caution to trading. \"This is a more realistic approach because the metals market is a 24 hours market and prices can move without limit,\" O'Neill said.", "labels": ["alum", "copper", "gold", "silver"]}, {"id": "test/17716", "text": "TOTAL HEALTH &lt;TLHT.O> TO MAKE ACQUISITION Total Health Systems Inc said it has agreed to acquire CoMED Inc of Denville, N.J., a health maintenance organization with over 63,000 subscribers, for an undisclosed amount of cash, the assumption of liabilities and the provision of up to 10 mln dlrs in equity and debt financing.

Traders said the new market would probably be a useful trading medium for Japan and other South East Asian tin interests although European traders generally appear to be reasonably satisfied with the current \"free market\" system which has been operating since London Metal Exchange, LME, tin trading ceased in October 1985. Dealers here will also want to see how acceptable foreign metal will be on the new market and what sort of demand develops for forward deliveries. There is also a view among European traders that, while the proposed Kuala Lumpur tin futures market would provide another useful reference point, a market inaugurated by the Malaysian government -- in the past viewed as a major player at times by the trade -- would make participants uncomfortable. Some traders expressed a preference for a resumption of trading on the London Metal Exchange, but they added that while there has been some behind the scenes discussion on the subject a definite move is unlikely until outstanding High Court litigation actions have been resolved. Spot tin prices on the European free market are currently around 4,200 stg per tonne for high grade metal in warehouse Rotterdam. Over the past 18 months the price moved to a ten year low of 3,400 stg in March 1986 and rebounded to as high as 4,680 stg in December 1986. This compares with 8,140 stg last paid when LME trading ceased in October 1985 and a record high tin price of 10,350 stg traded for Cash Standard Grade metal in June of that year. LME warehouse stocks are now near a two-year low at 28,065 tonnes, having fallen steadily from a record high of 72,485 tonnes reached in February 1986. Traders said the free market turned bullish during late last year based on producer forecasts of a supply/demand deficit of some 28,000/29,000 tonnes. Analysts were predicting prices of up to 5,000 stg per tonne during 1987. However, the trend was reversed following a strong upswing in sterling versus the dollar and values fell back briefly to 4,100 stg last month after approaching 4,700 stg in December. The decline accelerated as producers who had sold very little metal at the higher levels became competitive sellers. There was also a lack of significant demand from major steel mills who made large purchases prior to the new year. Traders say the 15 ITC creditor banks' original tin holdings of nearly 45,000 tonnes have now been almost halved, and the bulk of material still available is being held by Malaysian and Japanese firms which are reluctant to depress the market with unwanted metal. Some 80,000 tonnes were held by banks and brokers after the International Tin Council's, ITC, buffer stock manager halted support operations on the LME on behalf of the 22 members nations of the International Tin Agreement. The overhang of metal was reduced further by broker Shearson Lehman Brothers, which earlier this year reported having sold its ITC-related holdings and halved its overall tin position.

In a speech prepared for delivery as the United States made plans to protect 11 Kuwaiti oil tankers from Iranian attack, Reagan said the American people were aware that \"it is not our interests alone that are being protected.\" Saying that allied dependence on gulf oil was no secret, Reagan declared, \"During the upcoming summit in Venice, we will be discussing the common security interests shared by the western democracies in the MIDEAST Gulf. \"The future belongs to the brave. Free men should not cower before such challenges, and they should not expect to stand alone.\" Reagan will meet the leaders of Britain, France, West Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan at the economic summit, which will take place in Venice June 8-10. The 13th annual top-level meeting of the major industrial democracies will take place against a backdrop of rising congressional concern over Reagan's plan to protect gulf shipping and demands that the allies do more. These concerns were heightened by the May 17 Iraqi missile attack on the U.S. frigate Stark which killed 37 seamen. \"They died while guarding a chokepoint of freedom, deterring aggression and reaffirming America's willingness to protect its vital interests,\" Reagan said. In a pre-summit speech celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Marshall Plan, Reagan, who spoke to an audience of foreign affairs experts, also pledged to push for economic expansion by West Germany and Japan to bolster the world trading system. \"While the vibrancy of the U.S. economy has contributed enormously to the world expansion, preserving a growing world economy is the business of every member of the world trading community,\" he said. \"It will be made clear, especially to our friends in Japan and the Federal Republic of Germany, that growth-oriented domestic policies are needed to bolster the world trading system on which they depend.\" Reagan coupled this appeal with a call for compliance with allied accords on exchange rate stability. \"Economic policy decisions made last year in Tokyo and at this year's meetings of Group of Seven finance ministers in Paris and in Washington cannot be ignored or forgotten,\" he said. \"The commitments made at these meetings need to be translated into action.\"", "labels": ["crude", "ship"]}, {"id": "test/17751", "text": "MERRILL CORP &lt;MRLL.O> 1ST QTR APRIL 30 NET Shr 21 cts vs 20 cts Net 965,000 vs 726,000 Revs 13.4 mln vs 11.8 mln Avg shrs 4,606,242 vs 3,624,528", "labels": ["earn"]}, {"id": "test/17752", "text": "ADVANCED TELECOMMUNICATIONS &lt;ATEL.O> TO BUY CO Advanced Telecommunications Corp said it reached an agreement in principle to purchase &lt;Teltec Savings Communications Co>, a long distance telephone service in Florida.

Bilzerian told Reuters he believes his offer is superior to a leveraged buyout proposal disclosed in an announcement by the company this morning. The company said it is evaluating both proposals. Bilizerian said he was optimistic his offer will be accepted at a meeting of the board of directors Wednesday. Officials of Pay N' Pak did were not immediately available for comment. Bilzerian said he has a pool of 150 mln dlrs raised by Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc available for the tender and \"we may add a bank to that.\" \"We've submitted an agreement we're prepared to sign,\" he said. Shares not accepted in Bilzerian's tender would be exchangeable for 20 dlrs in convertible preferred stock. Asked what would happen if the leveraged buyout group, which the company did not identify, topped his offer between now and the board meeting, Bilzerian said he expected an opportunity to respond. Pay N' Pak gave no details about the buyout group, but did say the offer was contingent on financing and on an agrreement regarding management's equity participation. Bilzerian said it was his understanding that the management particpation was \"nominal.\" Pay N' Pak fell 1-1/2 to 19. Arbitrageurs said there was disappointment that neither of the offers topped 20 dlrs. \"We were expecting an offer north of (above) 21 or 22 dlrs,\" said one arbitrageur. The leveraged buyout plan was for 17.50 dlrs per share in cash and 2.50 dlrs in 13-1/2 pct cumulative preferred stock. Robert Cheadle, analyst at Montgomery Securities, said \"you have to ask yourself why no one in the industry made a bid.\" Scott Drysdale, analyst at Birr Wilson Securities, said the company has not made the best strategic moves over the years. \"They have not done the right things at the right time,\" he said, and as a result earnings per share have steadily declined since 1984. The 57 cts per share in earnings reported for the fiscal year ended in February was lower than 1978's earnings, he said. Earnings totaled 5.7 mln dlrs on revenue of 398.4 mln dlrs. Drysdale said Pay N' Pak has better trained sales people than many competitors, but it competes on price even though competitors have lower costs. The result is squeezed margins. He noted that there have been no other publicly identified bidders stepping forward since the company rejected an earlier Bilzerian proposal in mid-April. Another arbitrageur said it might not be too late for another bidder to get in the game.

The pipeline transmits roughly two-thirds sour crude and one-third sweet crude oil from the Midland, Texas region. Texaco sources said that if the pipeline service is restored by Friday there would be little problem in restoring oil which has been lost to the flood. \"But if the pipeline is down more than 10 days it will be difficult to make up without prorationing and we would not like to proration this pipeline, if we don't have to.\" The Basin Pipeline is jointly owned by Atlantic Richfield Corp &lt;ARC>, Shell Oil Co, a subsidiary of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group &lt;RD> and Texaco Inc &lt;TX>, which is the pipeline's operator. Peter Beutel, analyst at Elders Futures Inc, said crude oil futures contracts on New York Mercantile Exchange rose to new highs this afternoon following news of the pipeline break. July crude futures of West Texas Intermediate traded up to 19.60 dlrs a barrel, a rise of more than 20 cts. Cash market prices also firmed on the news with sellers of WTI raising offers to 19.60 dlrs a barrel. Sour crudes, which would be most affected by the pipeline shutdown, however, were slow to react to the news with West Texas Sour and Alaska North Slope holding 50 cts to one dlr a barrel below WTI, respectively. Dan Stevens, manager of public and government affairs at Texaco, said the company hopes to fix the pipeline in five days but that will depend on when the water level of the Red River recedes. There is already evidence that the water level is dropping and it appears the rain has stopped in the area affecting the pipeline, Stevens said. He said the segment of the pipeline that was damaged was underground and at a distance from the Red River that flooded. The pipeline runs over the Red River and under the subsoil nearby, according to Stevens. He said some of this subsoil was apparently washed away. The potential for environmental damage is being downplayed at this time despite the volume of oil that runs through this line.

USPCI, which has 8.7 mln shares outstanding, was trading at 48-1/8, down 3/8.

Augenthaler said that while USPCI was trading at only 34 dlrs a share at the time of the takeover bid, its announcement that same day of higher earnings expectations changed its value. USPCI said its second quarter earnings would exceed analysts expectations of 24 to 30 cts a share. At that price, USPCI could maintain a stock price in the low 40s, Augenthaler said. Hutton revised its 1987 earnings estimate for the waste management concern to 1.40 dlrs a share from 1.20 dlrs on the announcment, he said. It lifted its 1988 projection to 1.90 dlrs a share from 1.70 dlrs. In addition, analysts said the hazardous waste management business holds significant growth potential.

The 8-dlr-a-share offer by Entertainment Marketing Inc &lt;em> for Crazy Eddie comes less than two weeks after founder Eddie Antar and a firm controlled by the Belzbergs of Canada announced a bid to take the 32-store Crazy Eddie chain private. Analysts said Entertainment Marketing, whose revenues and profits quadrupled in 1986, may be looking to break into the highly competitive New York City retail market for consumer electronics, the nation's biggest, at a time the fortunes of electronics retailers have sagged. The analysts questioned whether Houston-based Entertainment Marketing, founded by a former electronics retailer but whose present buinesses are primarily as wholesale distributors, had the management expertise for retailing or was merely trying to drive up the price of the Crazy Eddie shares it already owns. \"I have mixed feelings,\" said analyst Dennis Telzrow of Eppler, Geurin and Turner, a Dallas brokerage. \"On the one hand it's probably a cheap price. On the other hand, does Entertainment Marketing have the management talent to run it and will the Crazy Eddie people leave?\" \"It's a risky strategy for Entertainment Marketing,\" said analyst Eliot Laurence of Wessels Arnold and Henderson, a Minneapolis brokerage. \"Electronics retailing is very management concentrated; they'd want to keep Crazy Eddie's management in place.\" Laurence said that, since Entertainment Marketing already owns 4.3 percent of Crazy Eddie's 31.3 million shares, it may be trying to get the Antar-Belzberg group to increase its 7-dlr-a-share offer. Shares of Crazy Eddie, which have jumped from the high 4-dlr range to above 7 dlrs since the Antar-Belzberg bid was announced May 20, rose another 50 cents Monday to 8.375 a share in over-the- counter trading. Antar, the reclusive founder of the chain in the New York City, Philadelphia and Connecticut areas, said last month that his group controlled 14 percent of Crazy Eddie's shares. A Crazy Eddie spokesman said the company's board has taken no decision on the Antar-Belzberg offer, worth some 187 mln dlrs since they own more shares than Entertainment Marketing. He would not comment on the new offer. Entertainment Marketing sells computer products such as disk drives and other, often discounted electronics goods to retailers, primarily in the southwest, and directly to consumers by cable television. In fiscal 1986, ending last January, its revenues rose to 87.9 mln dlrs from 21.3 mln dlrs the previous year. Net profit went to 3.2 mln dlrs from 750,000 dlrs in 1985. Entertainment Marketing, whose chief executive officer, Elias Zinn, once ran an electronics retailing business, said in a statement it had committed 50 mln dlrs toward the purchase of Crazy Eddie and had retained Dean Witter Reynolds Inc to assist in financing the balance. Analyst Telzerow estimated that the company would have to borrow about 100 mln dlrs to complete the proposed buyout since Crazy Eddie has cash and other assets worth about the same amount.

Earlier today, closely held Computerland, the largest PC retailing chain in the country, said it agreed to be bought by an investor group led by E.M. Warburg Pincus and Co, New York. Neither Computerland, which is 96 pct owned by its founder, William H. Millard, nor E.M. Warburg, a money management and venture capital firm, would disclose the value of the transaction. Analysts estimated that Computerland, whose 800 stores generated 1.4 billion dlrs in sales last year, would fetch 150 mln dlrs to 250 mln dlrs. Computerland franchise owners pay royalties averaging 5.9 pct to the parent company. Officials for E.M. Warburg referred all questions to Computerland.

Gordon said he plans to issue a decision tomorrow on Burlington Industries Inc's request for an injunction to stop Samjens Acquisition Corp's takeover bid for the company. Wall Street sources have said the outcome of the case could be pivotal in determining the winner in the fierce takeover battle for Burlington, the largest u.s. textile maker. Gordon presided over six hours of argument today by lawyers for Burlington and Samjens, a partnership formed by Dominion Textile Inc and New York investor Asher Edelman. Hearings are scheduled to continue tomorrow. A preliminary injunction would hold up Samjens 2.47 billion dlr offer until the case is decided. Burlington had previously agreed to a 2.44 billion dlr buyout from Morgan Stanley Group Inc &lt;MS>, one dlr per share lower than a sweetened 77 dlr per share bid made by Samjens last week. Burlington has not responded to the new Samjens offer. Burlington has alleged in its lawsuit that Edelman and Dominion used illegally obtained confidential information about the company in making their takeover attempt. That information, Burlington said, was provided by James Ammeen, a former Burlington executive, through PaineWebber Group Inc &lt;PWJ>. Ammeen, who had worked for Burlington for 23 years, had as many as 12 divisions with 50 pct of Burlington's sales reporting to him. When he left Burlington in November, 1985, Burlington said he signed a contract promising never to divulge inside information about the company. Burlington lawyers said shortly after he left he began working with a PaineWebber employee on a hostile plan to \"takeover the company, dismember the company and displace its management,\" Burlington lawyer Hubert Humphrey said. Samjens lawyers acknowledged it received information from PaineWebber, but argued the information was public information and could be obtained either from texitle industry analysts or Burlington's public financial statements. Burlington lawyers said PaineWebber and Ammeen met with Edelman and Dominion in November and continued to meet with them until a couple of days before Edelman and Dominion went public April 24 with their intention to take over the company. Burlington lawyers claim Dominion's board decided to attempt a takeover of Burlington after Ammeen met with the board in February. Burlington lawyers said Edelman and Dominion held discussions with PaineWebber and Ammeen about acting as financial advisers to Samjens. But they allege talks broke off because Painewebber and Ammeen could not satisfy Edelman and dominion with a written statement that they did not provide inside information. Lawyers for Samjens contended that Painewebber and Ammeen withdrew as potential advisers because Burlington chairman Frank Greenberg had called a PaineWebber executive and threatened legal action if PaineWebber got involved in an effort to takeover Burlilgnton. \"The ultimate question is not the price per share or the profit, but rather the permissable standards of conduct for those who would takeover an American company,\" said burlington lawyer Humphrey. Burlington lawyers also contended that Burlington, as the largest manufacturer of denim in the United States, would be in violation of anti-trust laws if it acquired Dominion, Canada's largest textile maker. Dominion has denim manufacturing plants in Georgia, which would reduce competition in the denim market, the lawyers said. Samjens' lawyers discounted the concern. They said the market for denim is more fragmented than Burlington contends and that Burlington has the ability to switch between light weight and heavy weight denim production as demand and price dictate. Samjens lawyers also pointed to a lawsuit filed by Burlington in Canada, in which it said it was considering a bid for Dominion. \"Surely, what would have been sauce for the goose would have been sauce for the gander,\" said Sidney Rosdeitcher, a Samjens lawyer.", "labels": ["acq"]}, {"id": "test/17864", "text": "EDELMAN DETAILS BURLINGTON &lt;BUR> OPTIONS SALE A tender offer of Asher Edelman and Dominion Textile Ltd &lt;DTX.TO> for Burlington Idustries Inc is not affected by the investors' sale of options to buy Burlington stock, according to an associate of Edelman.

Since February 1985, the dollar has nearly halved its value against the yen and the mark as part of an officially orchestrated campaign to make U.S. goods more competitive on world markets and redress gaping world trade imbalances. On April 27, the dollar fell to a 40-year low of 137.25 yen but has enjoyed a modest recovery over the last few weeks, topping 145 yen today for the first time in nearly two months. Many economists now believe that the dollar has fallen far enough to ease the trade deficit's drag on the U.S. economy. The U.S. trade gap narrowed to 13.6 billion dlrs in March from 15.1 billion in February and is expected to show continued improvement in April in volume, if not in real, terms. Keiichi Udagawa of Bank of Tokyo in New York said that if further progress is reported, the dollar would head back up towards 150 yen. \"There is growing consensus that the dollar has bottomed out for the medium term,\" added Tom Campbell of First National Bank of Chicago. Other factors supporting this bullish view were growing expectations that Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker would be reappointed for a third four-year term in August, Japan's larger-than-expected economic stimulus package last week and more favorably technical chart signals, analysts said. The dollar was also aided by Japan's moves to dampen speculative selling in Tokyo and by reports of active central bank intervention to support the dollar. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York said last week that the U.S. monetary authorities bought more than four billion dlrs during the February-April period -- the largest amount since the dollar crisis of the late 1970's. Discount Corp's McGroarty described the Fed's intervention volume as \"impressive\". James O'Neill of Marine Midland Bank was not so positive, however: \"the dollar has not yet bottomed out. After the trade data are released, the dollar could fall towards 1.77 marks and 140 yen.\" Similarly, Natsuo Okada of Sumitomo Bank in New York warned, \"I don't think the dollar has bottomed out yet.\" Although the dollar could rise as high as 146.50 yen, Okada said market impatience about the painstakingly slow decline of the U.S. trade deficit may lead to renewed pressure. Currency analysts also warned about an unfavorable reaction to the seven-nation economic Summit on June 8 to 10 in Venice, which is likely to focus on the implementation of previous commitments rather than yield any fresh initiatives. President Reagan said today, \"economic policy decisions made last year in Tokyo and at this year's meetings of Group of Seven finance ministers in Paris and Washington cannot be ignored or forgotten.\" \"The commitments made at these meetings need to be translated into action,\" he added in a speech, celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Marshall aid plan for Europe. Now that Tokyo has unveiled its fiscal stimulus package, analysts expected Bonn and the dollar/mark rate to bear the brunt of U.S. calls for further action. Marine Midland's O'Neill said, \"pressure will build up on Germany to take stimulative action like Japan.\" Some Japanese bank dealers warned that although the dollar could hold above 145 yen for some months it could also come under attack again if it seems the latest economic package is not having much impact on Japan's economy and its trade surplus.

The ETL cash offer values Monier's issued capital of 156.28 mln shares at 649 mln dlrs, against 593 mln for the CSR bid. Based on the current price of ETL shares of 1.05 dlrs, the alternative is worth 3.97 dlrs per share, but ETL said the value placed on its shares for the offer aproximates to the diluted asset backing of ETL as at March 31. ETL said the offer will have no minimum acceptance conditions and will be subject to Australian foreign investment and U.S. Hart-Scott-Rodino anti-trust clearances.

The measure, confirmed by a brokerage firm here, has effectively cut off all foreign participation in Venezuela's volatile currency market. The telex, issued on May 19, was signed by Carlos Hernandez Delfino, manager of the bank's department of international operations. The telex said the restriction on business with foreign brokers is in line with an earlier measure prohibiting foreign exchange houses from selling dollars or other foreign currencies to anyone living outside Venezuela. In recent weeks the Venezuelan government has denied rumours that it intends to impose foreign exchange controls to prop up the weakening bolivar. But brokers said the central bank's move is seen as a de facto currency control. \"It is definitely a control in the sense that there's no longer complete freedom to operate,\" one broker here said. \"Gradually they're imposing restrictions and the direction is towards complete control,\" the broker said. The broker, who requested anonymity, said virtually all his Venezuelan customers had stopped doing business with him since the central bank issued the telex and followed it up with telephone calls. He said that before the restriction was imposed the volume of his firm's transactions with Venezuela was about 10 mln dlrs a day. \"It was a frenetic market, it was really quite active,\" he said. The broker said he saw no logical explanation for the prohibition because his firm only acted act as an intermediary between Venezuelan brokers, exchange houses and banks. \"We weren't buying dollars from Venezuelans, that's ridiculous,\" he said. \"They've been on a rampage against foreigners.\" The broker noted that two months ago Venezuela's central bank quietly announced that banks doing foreign exchange business outside Venezuela would have to respect a new 200 pct reserve requirement. In February, the central bank also prohibited trading in bolivar futures, the broker said. \"We used to have a forward market,\" he said. \"For a small currency it was miraculous.\" He said the bolivar, which averaged 20.29 to the U.S. Dollar in 1986, would continue to slip from its current range of 28.35 to 28.50 because the central bank was rapidly running out of foreign reserves to support the currency on the free market.", "labels": ["money-fx"]}, {"id": "test/17878", "text": "ESSO RAISES SINGAPORE PETROL PUMP PRICES Esso Singapore Pte Ltd said it raised pump prices of petrol from today.

With money supply growth showing no sign of slowing down in May and the dollar stable or even rising against the mark, Schlesinger told Reuters that he was not convinced that a further cut in interest rates was needed. The economy is picking up, after contracting by a seasonally adjusted 1/2 to one pct in the first quarter from the fourth, he added. \"We may have an increase in gnp starting in the second quarter,\" he said in an interview. Concerned by the first quarter downturn, the U.S. Has been pressing West Germany to pump up its economy and boost its imports, either through fiscal or monetary policy. Schlesinger said the contraction in the first quarter was mainly due to adverse weather conditions, just as occured in 1986. Year-on-year growth was thus about two pct. He estimated that economic growth for the year as a whole would probably be between one and two pct. \"It is not a question of monetary conditions if domestic demand does not grow strongly,\" he said, noting that interest rates are at historically low levels and funds are ample. Schlesinger said he saw no signs that central bank money stock growth was slowing down from its recent year-on-year pace of 7-1/2 to eight pct, well above the Bundesbank's three to six pct target. He said the target could still be achieved but much will depend on the direction of long-term capital flows. Heavy inflows, particularly in January around the time of the EMS revaluation, boosted domestic money supply. \"There is still a certain hope that the net inflow of foreign money can be diminished or can even be a little bit reversed,\" Schlesinger said. A major reason for the inflows was the market's conviction that the mark was headed higher. \"As we can see from the market, expectations for a further revaluation of the deutschemark have diminished,\" Schlesinger said. The recent widening of interest rate differentials, the fact that the dollar has fallen sharply in a very short period and an improvement in real trade balances have all combined towards stabilizing the dollar, he said. Asked if central banks might act to prevent a sharp dollar rise, as the U.S. Did in March when the dollar rose above 1.87 marks, he said this would depend on the circumstances. At midday here, the dollar stood at 1.8340/45 marks. \"Central banks are always in contact about these fluctuations but I cannot give any answer how they would react,\" Schelsinger said. \"One has to look at how it (the market) is moving,\" he said, adding, \"It is not only our own case, it is also the American case.\" He said that the West German export industry has been hit hard by the dollar's sharp fall and would probably like to see some correction now. \"But it wouldn't be good to have short-term fluctuations,\" he said. \"Let us wait and see.\" \"It is mainly the strength of the (dollar) fall in a very short period which was a little bit of a shock, than the level (of rates) as such,\" Schlesinger said. The sharp rise of the mark, coupled with weak prices of such key commodities as oil, had a favourable impact on West German inflation down year. Although there have recently been signs of inflation picking up, he said that this was due to changes in key commodity prices. The underlying inflation rate this year would be unchanged, at about one to 1-1/2 pct, he said. Schlesinger said the problem of rapid money supply growth was longer term, in that the economy was building up the potential for a possible eventual resurgence of inflation. The above-target growth of money supply over the past 16 months had prompted some discussion of the usefulness of targets themselves, a matter which might be taken up at the mid-year meeting of the Bundesbank's council, Schlesigner said.

They said the relaxation of controls was now under review by the Petroleum Council, an advisory panel to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI). A spokesman for a major firm said, \"Deregulation would bring about a reorganization. If it's a by-product of freer competition, we have no choice but to accept it.\" The Council is due to close its discussions on June 12. The sources said the Council was likely to tell MITI it should end its 50 year-old protection of the industry. It should cut capacity to 3.8 mln barrels per day, about 75 pct of current capacity. Quotas should end for crude throughput and gasoline output, and oil tariffs should be abolished. They said deregulation was vital to promote more competition and efficiency, and most saw it as inevitable. \"Deregulation is taking place everywhere. Now it's our turn to see if we can survive cut-throat competition,\" said a source at one major Japanese oil company. A spokesman for a smaller refiner said, \"We'll have a hard time surviving, but that's something we must go through.\" \"In addition to our streamlining and efficiency programs for the oil division, we will exert efforts towards branching out further into other lines such as real estate and travel agencies,\" he said. Larger companies are also streamlining. Nippon Oil Co Ltd which had the largest share of refined products sales in the Japanese market in fiscal 1985, cut nine pct of its refining capacity in fiscal 1986. Cosmo Oil Co Ltd, the third largest seller of oil products in 1985, cut its workforce by some 20 pct last year, a spokesman for the company said. Between 1984 and 1986, on the recommendation of the Council, 13 oil companies were integrated into 11 companies within seven refining and marketing groups to improve the efficiency of the industry. Oil industry sources said this structure was now likely to be streamlined further into five refining groups. \"MITI means business. It will urge the major seven groups to merge into five to build up their muscles,\" a source said. A MITI official told Reuters he did not rule out the possibility of further mergers within the Japanese oil industry in the event of the relaxation of oil controls.

The National Economic Development Authority (NEDA) announced yesterday gross domestic product (GDP) grew 5.78 pct and gross national product (GNP) 5.53 pct in the first quarter from a year earlier. \"I don't see anything on the horizon that should cut it (growth) short,\" Fernandez said. NEDA said GNP had grown 3.56 pct and GDP 3.25 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986 from a year earlier. Last year's GNP growth, put earlier at 0.13 pct, was revised to 1.51 pct. \"Certainly I do not see any shortage in external resources and if GNP growth continues at this level I would assume that domestic resources on the fiscal side would be generated and would not be a stumbling block,\" Fernandez said. \"I think even before the figures came out, simply looking at key indicators, such as consumption of fuel oil and power, showed that the economy was on a different track from last year,\" he said. Fernandez said consumption tended to be heavier in the first and second quarters because of the dry weather, and it could drop off in the third quarter. He said the most significant sign of recovery lay in the manufacturing sector, which grew by 9.64 pct, after declines in 1985 and a slow turnaround in the second half of 1986. \"That is not a seasonal thing, it is secular,\" he said. He said the government had met all monetary targets set for the first quarter in consultation with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). It expected to draw down the fourth tranche from its 198 mln SDR stand-by arrangement soon. The Philippines has so far drawn three tranches totalling 58 mln SDRs from the arrangement expiring on April 23, 1988. Fernandez said an IMF mission would visit here in July or August to review performance in the January-June period. He said IMF repayments were projected to total 1.56 billion dlrs over the 1987-92 period and drawings only 236 mln dlrs. Repayments were inevitable and many countries would find their net repayments to the IMF rising in the next few years. \"It means that since there will be a net drain on ODA (official development assistance) accounts the commercial banking system will be requested to hold the line,\" he said. It is an internal constraint that exists because the IMF debt cannot be rescheduled, Fernandez said. The Philippines rescheduled 10.3 billion dlrs of its 28 billion dlr foreign commercial debt in March. Fernandez said Central Bank bills, introduced in March 1984 to mop up excess liquidity, had peaked at 43.1 billion pesos in April 1986. But their unwinding on maturity dates, started in October last year, had almost been completed. He said auctions of treasury bills, whose outstanding level touched 95.44 billion pesos on May 20, were going well. \"Treasury bills will remain a basic monetary tool,\" he said. Commenting on the country's foreign debt Fernandez said, \"I think the Philippine debt stock looms large because our own receipts from exports have not taken the same kind of leap forward as might have been suitable.\" The foreign debt is projected by the Central Bank to reach 29.04 billion dlrs by the end of 1987. NEDA said exports totalled 1.2 billion dlrs in the first quarter, while imports were 1.4 billion dlrs. Fernandez said the government had targeted GNP growth of between six and 6.5 pct this year. He cautioned that while growth so far was high the targets had not yet been achieved. Fernandez said he saw no merit in arguments by some economists that the peso, currently pegged at 20.50 to the dollar, ought to be devalued to make the country's exports more competitive. \"By being pegged to the dollar on a basket basis the peso has already substantially devalued against all of the country's trading partners,\" he said. On the proposed Omnibus Investment Code, he said he was opposed to a clause which would allow the unrestricted repatriation abroad of investments made during the first two years after the imposition of the Code. The imposition of the Code, scheduled for last January, has been delayed by objections from some business groups. \"I think any central bank, certainly this one after the events of the past two or two and a half years, has to be prudent. This is not the time to throw all caution to the winds and I'm not about to do that,\" Fernandez said. \"It would be ideal if we reach a point where movement of capital and earnings can be free,\" he said. \"We have had one year of reasonably good results.

A spokesman for the Economics Ministry in Bonn said there was no political motivation behind publishing the figures on June 11, the day after the Venice economic summit ends. \"There is no political motivation.

However, government officials have ruled out any further tax reduction packages to supplement a major program of stimulatory fiscal measures already underway.

The government has confirmed that growth was negative in the first 1987 quarter. But year-on-year growth is expected to be about two pct. Schlesinger today repeated the Bundesbank's reluctance to cut its official interest rates further. Its key discount rate, at three pct, is just above historical lows. West German officials are likely to emphasise at the Venice summit that domestic demand, which draws in goods from abroad, is already outstripping export performance, which has suffered from an 80 pct rise of the mark against the dollar in just over two years. The government has pointed out that depressed exports are the main reason for the current weakness in the economy, but says that later in the year stronger domestic demand will compensate for this setback.

President of the powerful and independent West German central bank, the Bundesbank, Poehl is likely to have his contract renewed for another eight years when it expires at the end of this year, government officials say. (Index of economic spotlights, see page ECRA) But no official announcement has yet been made, raising eyebrows in West Germany's business community. The ebullient Poehl spent seven years in Bonn in top ministerial posts under the Social Democrats, now in opposition, before he moved to the Bundesbank. There has been speculation that Chancellor Helmut Kohl would try to replace Poehl with a man closer to his own Christian Democrats. But officials noted that Poehl has worked closely and successfully with Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg since Kohl's government took office in 1982. Poehl, the most senior central banker apart from Paul Volcker of the United States, enjoys a strong international reputation which it would take a newcomer years to build up. Given these circumstances, Kohl will probably overlook Poehl's past as an adviser to former Social Democrat Chancellor Willy Brandt, and top aide to Helmut Schmidt when he was Finance Minister, bankers said. It was Schmidt who, as Chancellor, appointed Poehl to his present job in 1980. In recent months, with the mark's strong rise against the dollar, Poehl has made exchange rates the central concern of the Bundesbank's council, a highly conservative institution which has doggedly pursued monetary policies to prevent inflation catching hold. Older Germans can remember two bouts of galloping inflation this century. But with consumer prices falling for much of 1986, and inflation negligible so far this year, Poehl thinks it is safe to relax the monetary reins a little and concentrate on the dangers to the German economy of a bloated exchange rate. \"I am of the opinion that efforts to stabilise the dollar/mark rate have reached a high priority, also for the Bundesbank, because a further massive revaluation of the mark would endanger the economy in West Germany,\" he told business journalists in Frankfurt recently. Ute Geipel, head of research at Citibank AG, says that Poehl's reappointment would guarantee flexible monetary policy. \"Poehl's policy has always been a policy which does not focus so rigidly on domestic factors, but also on the external economy,\" she said. An economist at a German bank, who declined to be identified, said \"If Poehl is confirmed in his post, it will certainly be a plus for the pragmatic course which is not so rigidly oriented towards money supply.\" One of Poehl's great struggles recently has been to persuade the United States to stop \"talking down\" the dollar. For Poehl, the significance of the February Louvre Accord was that the United States agreed to join efforts to stabilise currencies. The Louvre Accord was greeted with scepticism by currency dealers who said they would soon put it to the test. But in fact the dollar has been relatively stable since the pact. \"This is because the markets know - or perhaps because they don't know - what the central banks can do,\" Poehl says of intervention in currency markets which can quickly turn rates round, making a speculator's position worthless. Poehl was born in 1929 and worked as a financial journalist in the 1960s before starting his ministerial career. A relaxed sun-tanned figure who enjoys cracking jokes over a glass of beer, he is hardly a stereotype central banker. He is also a keen sportsman who likes to watch football and play golf. Poehl says currency market intervention cannot substitute for correct economic policies if exchange rates are imbalanced. \"But you can achieve an enormous effect with a small amount if you strike at the right moment,\" he said. Bundesbank dealers are very professional and skilled. \"They've burnt the fingers of many people,\" he said. And unlike the speculators, Poehl notes, the Bundesbank dealers usually make a profit.", "labels": ["money-fx"]}, {"id": "test/17916", "text": "FINLAND'S CURRENT ACCOUNT IN DEFICIT IN 1ST QTR Finland's current account balance of payments showed a deficit of 2.5 billion markka in first quarter 1987 against a deficit of 3.2 billion in the same period last year, the Bank of Finland said in a statement.", "labels": ["bop"]}, {"id": "test/17922", "text": "DE LA RUE RAISES ANNUAL PROFITS BY 12.7 PCT Year ended March 31, 1987 Fin div 9.25p making 12p vs 10.74p Shr 28.3p vs 27.5p Pretax profit 55.63 mln stg vs 49.36 mln Net 38.80 mln vs 33.64 mln Turnover 444.10 mln vs 309.85 mln Net interest payable 3.50 mln vs 3.79 mln Profit share of related companies 7.62 mln vs 9.64 mln Note - The De La Rue Co.

It said 1986 plantings fell due to removal of crop incentives, because farmers could earn more from other crops and because technical and seed improvements had not been widely disseminated. The official press had estimated the 1986/87 sugar crop (November/March) at 4.82 mln tonnes, down from 5.2 mln a year earlier, and domestic consumption at six mln tonnes a year. The Yunnan 1986/87 sugar harvest was a record 521,500 tonnes, the provincial daily said. It gave no year-earlier figure. Output in Guangxi was 1.04 mln tonnes, the New China News Agency said without giving a year-earlier figure. The Nanfang Daily said production in Guangdong province fell to estimated 1.92 mln tonnes from 1.96 mln and that the area under sugar was dropping. \"Supply of cane (in Guangdong) is inadequate,\" the newspaper said. Processing costs are rising and the economic situation of nearly all the mills is not good. To guarantee supply of cane is a major problem.\" A Western diplomat said sugar output also fell n Fujian, south China's fourth major producer, where there was a drop in area planted. He said the rural sectors in Guangdong and Fujian were wel developed, enabling farmers to choose crops according to the maximum return, meaning that many had avoided sugar. The Farmers Daily said a peasant in the ortheast province of Heilongjiang could gross 108 yuan from one mu (0.0667 hectares) of soybeans and 112 yuan from one mu of corn but only 70 from one mu of sugarbeet. The paper said the profit margin of mills in China fell to 4.7 pct last year from 11.87 pct in 1980. Mills lacked the capital to modernise and they competed with each other for raw materialsX, it added. This resulted in falling utilisation rates at big, mode{nised mills. The price of sugar had not changed in 20 years, the official press has said. Customs figures showed China imported 1.18 mln tonnes of sugar in calendar 1986, down from 1.9 mln in 1985. The diplomat said stocks at end-August 1986 were 2.37 mln tonnes, up from 1.92 a year earlier. A foreign trader here said China accumulated large stocks in 1982-85 when provincial authorities were allowed to import sugar on their own authority. This practice was stopped in 1986 when the central government resumed control of imports. \"As China lacked storage, much of these imports was stored in Qinghai, Inner Mongolia and other inland areas,\" the diplomat said. The trader said transporting stocks from these areas to consumers in east and south China was a problem, particularly as coal had priority. \"How quickly they can move the sugar is one factor determining import levels,\" he said. Another factor was the quality of the harvest in Cuba, China's major supplier through barter trade, he said. \"China bought two distress cargoes last week, for about 152/153 dlrs a tonne,\" he added. \"China is not a desperate buyer now. But if the Cuban harvest is bad, it will have to go into the open market.\" A Japanese trader said Peking's major concern regarding imports was price. \"While the foreign trade situation has improved this year, foreign exchange restraints persist,\" he said.

The central bank's statement added that the measure would be effective until the end of July. Bankers said the measure is designed to curb the inflow of foreign exchange and slow the growth of money supply. They added that the move, which sparked a record single day plunge of the local stock market, would limit their ability to lend foreign exchange to importers and exporters. Foreign exchange borrowings by local and foreign banks reached almost 12 billion U.S. Dlrs by the end of April, according to official statistics. Last week the central bank said that from today it would reduce its purchase of forward U.S. Dollars from banks to 40 pct from 90 pct of the value of the contract. It said the move was needed because of \"distortions\" in the foreign exchange market. Exporters, nervous about the appreciating Taiwan dollar, have been heavily selling forward U.S. Dollars on the interbank market to avoid exchange rate losses. Official figures show that forward U.S. Dollar sales in May reached a record of almost six billion U.S. Dlrs against 5.9 billion in April. All Taiwan's foreign exchange earnings must be converted into local dollars, boosting money supply at a time of booming exports. Money supply rose a seasonally adjusted 51.86 pct in the year to end-April, raising fears of higher inflation. In March the central bank clamped tight restrictions on remittances of foreign exchange by companies and individuals to Taiwan in a move to curb inflows of speculative money. Economists and bankers estimate that the rising value of the local dollar has attracted about ten billion U.S. Dlrs of speculative money into Taiwan since early last year. It has flowed in mainly from Hong Kong, Japan and the U.S.. Since September 1985 the Taiwan dollar has risen by about 22 pct against the U.S. Dollar. Bankers said the government's efforts to stabilise the foreign exchange market were a prelude to lifting all curbs on capital outflows. The central bank has said the controls will be dropped by the end of July or early August.

U.K. Portfolio investment is also returning, while foreign buyers see U.K. Growth propects and high bond yields as attractive. They will be strong buyers of U.K. Assets, notably equities, once the election is out of the way, Bell said. Analysts see this pressure as the main hope for lower interest rates, as the government is expected to try to reverse the loss of export competitiveness caused by a strong pound. Today, however, the pound hardly moved on the reserves news, dipping on its trade-weighted index against a basket of currencies from 73.1 pct of its 1975 value at 1000 GMT to 73.0 pct at 1100 GMT, half an hour after the figures were released. \"The market doesn't want to do anything because of the election,\" commented an economist at a big U.S. Investment bank. Several dealers and analysts added that market forecasts of a rise in reserves of between one and three billion dlrs had overestimated the amount of pound sales that were likely to have been disguised by swap arrangements or transactions on the forward market. The market also seemed to have overestimated the amount of sterling the Bank of England bought at the end of May to smooth the pound's sudden downturn, while some of the intervention reported in May probably occurred in April, they said. The key three months interbank money market rates eased about 1/8 point, reflecting cautious hopes that the downtrend in U.K. Interest rates will be revived following the reserves news, analysts said. Government bond prices initially firmed, but the market was muted as traders worried about the funding implications of another huge rise in reserves, they added. Morgan Grenfell's Bell forecast a half point base rate cut from the current nine pct level soon after the election, so long as poll projections of another Conservative victory prove accurate, with another half point later. Justin Silverton, equity economist at Credit Suisse Buckmaster and Moore, said a full point reduction might be possible. \"Sterling will be held down by interest rate cuts in future, rather than this active intervention,\" he predicted. Kevin Boakes of Greenwell Montagu Gilt-Edged cautioned against over-optimistic forecasts, but agreed a half point cut looked likely. A cut before the election has been virtually ruled out. \"The Bank (of England) is both worried about the political problem of cutting rates during an election campaign ... And has signalled some worry about broad money (growth),\" said Robin Marshall, chief U.K. Economist at Chase Manhattan Securities. He said the 10 billion dlrs increase in total reserves in the past seven months may foreshadow full U.K. Entry into the European Monetary System. But Bell said the authorities would like to see another 10 or 15 billion dlrs in the reserves before joining, if they did so. But, unlike many analysts, he doubted the U.K. Will go in.", "labels": ["interest", "reserves"]}, {"id": "test/17967", "text": "SEAL INC &lt;SINC.O> 2ND QTR APRIL 30 NET Shr profit 29 cts vs loss six cts Net profit 645,000 vs loss 118,000 Sales 7,802,000 vs 4,330,000 1st half Shr profit 58 cts vs profit 10 cts Net profit 1,255,000 vs profit 212,000 Sales 14.5 mln vs 8,912,000 Avg shrs 2,183,150 vs 2,072,779", "labels": ["earn"]}, {"id": "test/17968", "text": "ENI UNIT AGIP PETROLI BUYS STAKE IN U.S. COMPANY A subsidiary of state energy concern Ente Nazionali Idrocarburi &lt;ENTN.MI> (ENI) said it has acquired a 50 pct stake in &lt;Steuart Petroleum Co>, an independent U.S. Oil products company.

Faced with competing demands for increased military and police spending and the pressing need for more funds for black housing and education, Finance Minister Barend Du Plessis is expected to raise significantly the government's overall expenditure targets when he presents the budget to parliament, the analysts said. Analysts expect Du Plessis to provide for a rise in state spending at least equal to the 16 pct inflation rate for the financial year that started on April 1, while ignoring pleas from the private sector to stimulate growth by cutting taxes. \"Fiscal policy has become gradually more expansionary, but simply raising government spending and increasing the budget deficit is an inflationary form of stimulation,\" said Rob Lee, chief economist at South African Mutual Life Assurance Co. South Africa this year is targeting inflation-adjusted growth in GDP of three pct against an increase last year of less than one pct. Growth in GDP over the past decade has averaged about 1.5 pct, while the unemployment rate among blacks has spiralled to over 30 pct. Economists estimate that the government's spending target will rise to about 47 billion rand, with revenue budgeted at around 40 billion rand. This would leave a budget deficit before borrowing of about seven billion rand, or four pct of GDP. The government, having consistently overshot its own spending targets for more than a decade, also faces a credibility crisis over expenditure figures outlined in the budget, analysts said. \"The budget is invariably too optimistic on expenditure,\" said Standard Bank Ltd in a budget preview. Many analysts in the private sector are now paying less attention to the figures presented in the budget and are using their own estimates of expenditure to draw conclusions for the money and capital markets. South African Mutual's Lee believes government spending will again exceed the budget target and increase to around 49 billion rand this year, leaving a deficit of between 5 and 5.5 pct of GDP, compared with a three pct limit suggested by the IMF. \"The IMF limit is obviously going to be abandoned,\" predicted one analyst, noting that South Africa has moved steadily away from austerity measures recommended by the IMF over the past two years. The policy shift followed a dramatic deterioration in the political situation and the onset of an economic crisis triggered by the refusal of major foreign banks to roll over loans to the country in September 1985. Against a background of Western economic sanctions, falling per capita incomes, rising joblessness and high inflation, government officials say economic growth is the prime objective. But private-sector economists caution that the government's ability to promote growth by boosting state spending is constrained by the need to maintain a large surplus on the current account of the country's balance of payments. Most of that surplus, this year estimated at around 2.5 billion dlrs, will be swallowed up by repayments on the nation's estimated 23 billion dlr foreign debt in terms of an arrangement reached earlier this year with major international creditor banks. Within these constraints, economists believe Du Plessis has little room to manoeuvre. Analysts argue recent rises in civil service salaries and budgeted spending increases for the state-owned Post Office and South African Transport Services suggest that major tax concessions to individuals or corporations are unlikely. Du Plessis earlier this year announced small concessions for taxpayers in a mini-budget before the May 6 whites-only election. The poll delayed presentation of the national budget. \"This will not be a very exciting budget,\" commented Harry Schwarz, spokesman on finance for the liberal Progressive Federal Party. \"I do not expect any major tax cuts as all the sweets were given out before the election.\"", "labels": ["cpi", "gnp"]}, {"id": "test/17972", "text": "DEL E.

Previewing the summit, which he expected would not produce any major new economic initiatives, Lawson told reporters work remained to be done on improving the conditions for lasting world economic growth.\u00fcside measures to boost growth, he said. \"I think it is possible that there may be scope for a further reduction in interest rates in Germany,\" he added, but stressed that he had had no indication that such a move was likely. He made no mention of Japanese interest rates. Lawson said the U.S. Should embark on \"a gradual reduction of its fiscal deficits over the next two or three years.\" He said the February 22 Louvre accord had produced \"satisfactory exchange rate stability,\" in part thanks to heavy coordinated intervention of Group of Seven central banks, and he was \"content\" with sterling's exchange rate. Pointing to the record 4.8 billion stg rise in U.K. May currency reserves announced today he said, \"we have been playing a very full part ourselves ... We have been intervening to a very much greater extent than we had done hitherto.\" Lawson said there was a risk that the Louvre agreement may falter if member states did not implement the macro-economic commitments underlying the accord. \"Certainly it would be more difficult to maintain exchange rate stability if countries are seen not to implement their commitments in Paris ... In this respect.\" He said the U.S. Budget deficit was \"very important.\" Noting the 6,000 billion yen economic package announced by Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone last week Lawson said, \"what is really needed in Japan is an increase in merchandise imports. Supply side measures are critical.\" \"There is a specific range of consumer and agricultural goods where they have an extremely restrictive regime which is wholly unjustified,\" he said. Lawson doubted that Tokyo's partners would indulge in \"Japan bashing\" at the summit especially after the economic stimulation package and the announcement of Nakasone's plans to increase Japanese development aid over the next three years. Japan's more flexible stance on Tokyo stock exchange membership would also help deflect criticism, he said. He said he thought West Germany would instead come under pressure at the summit to adopt similar stimulation measures to jack up faltering economic growth. In this respect Lawson said he hoped Bonn would bring forward to January 1988 part of its agreed package of tax cuts scheduled for 1990. He also called on Bonn to push ahead with the privatisation of German national industries. On debt, Lawson said he expected a three point British plan to alleviate the burden of the poorest sub-saharan countries to make progress in Venice. The plan, involving concessional rescheduling of sovereign debt in the Paris Club, was first proposed at the IMF and World Bank meetings in Washington earlier this year. Lawson said he would seek \"to consolidate political backing for the plan at the Venice summit\" and hoped the programme would be finalised at the Autumn meetings of the IMF and World Bank. He welcomed the recent moves by Citicorp and Chase Manhattan to increase sharply their Third World debt provisions. \"First, it is a blow for realism. Second, because the market response has shown that banks have much less to fear from this sort of move than they felt before Citicorp,\" he said. U.K. Banks should follow Bank of England recommendations, strengthening their balance sheets and making more provisions. \"They have done it to some extent, they need to do it more,\" Lawson said, adding it was up to the banks themselves to determine the appropriate size of provisions. He also said the dismantling of farm subsidies would be discussed at the summit. \"There is a consensus, which we have to push further.\"", "labels": ["money-fx"]}, {"id": "test/17981", "text": "CENTEL &lt;CNT> COMPLETES SALE Centel Corp said it completed the sale of its water properties serving 8,000 customers in four southwestern Kansas communities to Central Kansas Utility Co of Columbia, Mo.

ETL said today it would offer 4.15 dlrs each for Monier's issued capital of 156.28 mln shares, plus a share alternative. This compares with a 3.80 dlr cash element in CSR's proposed bid. The proposed offer by ETL, controlled by New Zealand entrepreneur Allan Hawkins, came after it built up a 14.99 pct stake in Monier in a 95 mln dlr share raid in recent days. Herbert said Britain's Redland Plc &lt;RDLD.L>, which holds just under 50 pct of Monier, still supported the CSR bid and had told CSR it is not a seller. He said Redland wanted to maintain and build on its operations in Australia and the U.S., Where Monier has built up a strong presence, notably in roofing tile manufacture. The CSR offer contains a put and call option agreement with Redland. This enables Redland to accept the CSR bid within six months of its close or to lift its stake to 50.1 pct in the same period and to run Monier as a joint venture with CSR. CSR has said that Redland will take up the second option. ETL has declined to say why it intervened in Monier, beyond describing it as a long term investment. ETL would bring no synergies to Monier, unlike CSR which is a leader in building materials, Herbert said. \"We fit better with Monier,\" he said. CSR has said that it will concentrate development on its core businesses of sugar and building materials after its moves into energy several years ago. Asked what he thought ETL's bid sought to achieve, Herbert said: \"I'm puzzled as to what Hawkins' strategy is. One has to wonder if Monier is the main target.\" Herbert said CSR had no plans to raise its bid, and said a higher price would be difficult to justify on fundamentals. Monier was trading at 2.80 dlrs when CSR launched its original bid of 3.50, or 16.8 times earnings, in late April. The shares closed at 3.90 dlrs today, down 25 cents on yesterday, after ETL withdrew on reaching the top foreign shareholding level permitted without Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) approval. Its bid is subject to FIRB approval. Herbert also said that institutions, which are more likely to accept a share alternative than cash, would have to judge the respective values of ETL and CSR shares. ETL is the third group to become involved in a possible acquisition of Monier this year. Redland held discussions on a possible takeover before the CSR bid emerged but the negotiations foundered on the price. Share analysts said that for this reason, they did not think ETL's intervention would flush out a full Redland bid although Monier's ultimate fate rests in its hands. \"Redland is still in the driving seat,\" said Tim Cohen of &lt;Ord Minnett Ltd>, adding that Redland would be happier having CSR as a partner in running Monier than ETL.

Pointing to the reserves data, Lawson said, \"We have been playing a very full part ourselves\" in meeting our commitments toward exchange rate stability as agreed in Paris. \"We wish to see it (stability) continuing,\" he added.

This would limit the inflationary impact of intervention, he said. \"Sterilisation will be dictated by market tactics...Not necessarily in the month in which intervention occurs,\" Lawson said. \"I am confident that we can sterilise on this scale.\"", "labels": ["money-fx"]}, {"id": "test/18051", "text": "FED NOT EXPECTED TO TAKE MONEY MARKET ACTION The Federal Reserve is not expected to intervene in the government securities market to add or drain reserves at its usual intervention time this morning, economists said.

The Bundesbank steered money market rates lower last month by cutting the rate on its security repurchase pacts, and is unlikely to cap this move with a cut in leading interest rates in the near future, they said. The council will meet in Saarbruecken, and the meeting will be followed by a news conference at around 1030 GMT. But Bundesbank officials noted that a news conference was usually called when the council meets outside Frankfurt, and did not necessarily herald any policy moves. Bundesbank Vice-President Helmut Schlesinger said today there was no reason to cut interest rates because money supply growth had shown no signs of slowing in May and the dollar was stable against the mark. Schlesinger told Reuters in Tokyo, where the Bundesbank has opened a representative office, that the West German economy was now picking up after contracting by a seasonally adjusted 1/2 to one pct in the first quarter. Money market dealers said call money was likely to hold in a 3.50/70 pct range for most of this month, after the Bundesbank switched last month to tenders by interest rate at a minimum bid rate of 3.50 pct, allocating funds at 3.55 pct. \"They have set this signal and indicated they could maybe lower market rates even further, but not with the discount or Lombard,\" Winfried Hutmann, chief economist of Schroeder, Munchmeyer, Hengst Investment GmbH said. Werner Chrobok, managing partner at Bethmann Bank, said German rates were among the lowest in industrial countries and around historical lows for West Germany. A further cut in rates would have little impact on the economy as banks are in any case reporting slack credit demand, with companies swimming in liquidity, Chrobok said. The Bundesbank would therefore be reluctant to make a move on interest rates, when this would be better held in reserve. \"The Bundesbank is frightened of using up its powder,\" he said. A cut in the discount or Lombard rates, to bring them in line with the new structure of money market rates since last month, would have little practical significance, dealers said. The Bundesbank could therefore act on these if it wanted a diplomatic gesture before next week's Venice summit. But Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl has often made it clear in the past he opposes such gestures as mere \"eyewash.\" Economists said it was really up to the Bonn government to cut taxes, rather than for the Bundesbank to ease monetary policy, to meet pressure on West Germany at the Venice summit. But with Bonn struggling to finance already announced tax cuts and falling tax revenue widening the federal budget deficit, it is hard to see how Bonn could cut taxes further. \"The Bonn government will be in a very weak position in Venice because they can't risk increasing the deficit further,\" said Schroeder, Muenchmeyer, Hengst's Hutmann. Bethmann's Chrobok said if anything is to happen before Venice, it must be in fiscal rather than monetary policy. \"But I don't expect any convincing measures,\" he said. Money market dealers noted that call money continued to normalize today, falling to 3.60/70 pct from 3.75/85 yesterday and as much as five pct on Friday when it was pushed up by month-end distortions. Call money could come under upwards pressure later this month because of a major round of tax payments by banks on behalf of customers, starting in the week beginning June 15. Two public holidays that week could also distort the market. Dealers said they expected the Bundesbank to allocate funds tomorrow in the latest repurchase pact at an unchanged 3.55 pct, after setting an unchanged minimum bid rate of 3.50 pct, and to fully replace the 5.5 billion marks in an outgoing pact. But dealers said it was possible the Bundesbank would allocate funds at 3.6 pct rather than 3.55. That would not represent a tightening of policy, however. Because the Bundesbank scales down bids which it allocates at the minimum accepted rate, some banks may try to get a full allocation by bidding heavily at 3.6 pct, dealers said. On another issue, Poehl has said the Bundesbank is likely to lift restrictions on private use of the European Currency Unit (ECU) at one of its meetings soon. Saarbruecken would be a suitable place for an announcement on this gesture to European unity, as it is the capital of the Saarland bordering France, and was twice under French occupation this century. But dealers said an ECU announcement was unlikely to come this week, as a number of technical and legal matters had still to be resolved, for instance how German ECU accounts would be treated for minimum reserve purposes.", "labels": ["interest", "money-fx"]}, {"id": "test/18093", "text": "ALCAN REDUCES COST OF PLANNED SMELTER Alcan Aluminium Ltd said it has cut the expected cost of its planned Laterriere, Quebec, smelter by using enhanced Grande Baie reduction technology.

It added the council believed \"an intensification of the already expansionary stimulation of monetary and financial policy is not called for.\" Ost's statement said experts believed further pressure on West Germany to adapt to external economic factors would not increase. The government regularly uses the term \"changed external economic factors\" when referring to the fall of the dollar, which has severely damaged West German exports. Bonn officials have said they expect exports to pick up during the year, but could still fall below the 1986 level. Along with other leading industrial countries, West Germany agreed to a package of measures at a meeting in Paris in February aimed at stemming the fall of the dollar. The stance taken by the experts backs up the official position of the West German government ahead of next week's seven nation summit in Venice, where Bonn is expected to be pressed by the U.S. And other partners to boost its economy. West German government officials have stressed Bonn is not in a position to stimulate growth further since tax cuts due next year and 1990 are already stretching the budget. The Bundesbank has also ruled out a quick cut in official interest rates although it sees market rates continuing low. The experts' prediction for economic growth this year of between 1-1/2 and two pct is a slight downward revision from a forecast made last November when two pct growth was forecast. Many independent forecasters have revised down 1987 predictions in light of the downturn in exports.

In rejecting the takeover proposal by the U.S. subsidiary of Swiss-based Ciba-Geigy AG, the company said it was unfair. The Spectra-Physics board voted unanimously, with two Ciba-Geigy representatives not participating, to reject the Swiss-based chemical and pharmaceutical company's takeover bid, citing an opinion from its financial advsior, Morgan Stanley and Co Inc, that it is \"inadequate and unfair from a financial point of view to the holders of shares,\" the company said.

While the consensus is for an increase, a few would not rule out the possibility of an decline. Traders said that barring any surprises in tonight's report, they expect the report to be neutral to bearish for oil prices. Heating oil stocks are also likely to build and runs to be steady to slightly higher, which could add pressure on oil prices, the analysts said. Crude oil was seen likely to build assuming imports continue at relatively high levels. Analysts expect gasoline stocks to rise 500,000 to two mln barrels above the 234 mln reported for May 22. Peter Beutel, oil analyst with Elders Futures inc, who looks for a build said, \"We have had five weeks of gasoline demand at 7.3 mln bpd or more and it is likely to taper off to between 6.7-7.0 mln bpd, which should make stocks build. Demand would have to stay above 7.0 mln bpd to have a draw,\" he added. Rising demand is why oil traders and analysts expect a draw in stocks of about of about one mln barrels. The U.S. Energy Information Administration in its latest report for the four weeks ending may 22 said that gasoline demand was up 4.4 pct to 7.3 mln bpd from the previous year. But analysts said hopes of reduced stocks is likely to founder on increased runs in refineries, which could be up 0.3 pct above May 22's 81.2 pct capacity operated. Such an increase would raise runs about 100,000 bpd and add to U.S. stocks. But some analysts said that refiners may have held refinery runs. Heating oil stocks were also expected to build between 700,000 barrels and one mln from the 96 mln barrel level reported last week, but a rise in distillate stocks was discounted as having a market impact at this time. \"A build is seasonal now and not out of line with last year,\" one futures analyst said.

But he said the U.S. Would not lift the selective economic sanctions it imposed on Japanese imports in April until Tokyo changed its sales policies concerning computer microchips. Speaking in a televised news conference linking several European capitals, Shultz said it was heartening that the Japanese had confronted the problem of stimulating domestic and global demand. \"There is an even greater amount of stimulus than was originally thought,\" said Shultz, speaking from Washington. \"It is a lot more than nothing. It is more than was talked about when (Prime Minister Yasuhiro) Nakasone was here. \"It involves a major reduction in tax rates and we believe that getting the tax burden down is one way of stimulating the economy,\" he added. But asked by Japanese reporters, also linked into the news conference, whether the positive reaction meant the U.S. Might decide at next week's Venice summit to lift its sanctions on some Japanese electronic goods, Shultz replied: \"These sanctions were undertaken on the basis of an agreement that had been reached between the United States and Japan on various sale practices and prices relating to the chip market. \"They will be lifted as the facts of change by Japan to the agreement that it made become evident.\" He said U.S. Officials had only been able to monitor the situation for a month and that it was impossible to determine a trend on only one month's data. The U.S. Imposed 100 pct import duties on personal computers, colour televisions and power tools, alleging that Japan had violated last September's bilateral agreement by selling computer chips at below fair market value. Shultz said West Germany and other nations would also do well to look at what they could do to stimulate demand. Asked whether the U.S. Could reasonably ask its allies to take action to stimulate the world economy without a bold American initiative to reduce the size of the federal budget deficit, Shultz said moves were already underway to tackle the problem. He said by the end of the current fiscal year the deficit would probably be reduced by around 35 billion dlrs against last year, and that the budget being worked on this year would contain a major reduction.", "labels": ["trade"]}, {"id": "test/18149", "text": "CHAMPION HOME &lt;CHB> SELLS TWO PROPERTIES Champion Home Builders Inc said it sold the Commerce Meadows 600-site manufactured housing rental community in Commerce Township, Michigan, for a pre-tax gain of about 900,000 dlrs and the Heron Cay 610-site adult community in Vero Beach, Florida, for a nominal pre-tax gain.

Ambassadors to the EC from African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) states told a press conference the tax would hit the exports of 26 ACP countries. They said the EC failed to follow consultation procedures laid down in the Lome Convention which regulates relations between ACP states and the bloc for moves which could affect trade between the two sides. They also said the EC would be in breach of an undertaking not to bring in new protectionist measures during the current Punta del Este round of world trade negotiations being held under GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) auspices. The EC Commission has proposed a tax of up to 330 European currency units (Ecus) a tonne on both imported and EC-produced vegetable and marine fats for human consumption, which could raise up to two billion Ecus a year. EC farm ministers, who would have to approve such a tax, are split on the issue and are expected to decide it at a marathon meeting on EC farm prices beginning in Luxembourg on June 15. Jamaican ambassador Leslie Wilson said ACP countries are convinced this would lead to EC industry substituting products made within the bloc for oil and fat imports. The ACP estimates this would result in a fall of 160 to 185 mln Ecus in its member country exports. \"We can't believe the EC would willingly take measures to undermine our countries, but such would be the impact of these measures,\" Wilson said. The U.S. and Malaysia say their exports would also be hit by the proposed tax and they may take retaliatory action if it is approved. Wilson said the ACP would take such steps only \"as a very last resort,\" but added that the ACP is in touch with other countries which oppose the plan. Wilson, who was chairing the news conference, made it clear Jamaica itself would not be hit by the tax as it does not export oils and fats.

The Office of Technology Assessment, a nonpartisan arm of Congress told a House Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee hearing there was still concern for the future of parts of the U.S. textile and apparel industry, but there was more reason for optimism than a few years ago. \"While textile producers are making significant investments, they could do more,\" OTA analyst Henry Kelly said. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the nonpartisan budget analysis arm of Congress, said federal loans or loan guarantees would be preferable options for Congress rather than increased trade protection which could lead to foreign retaliation. CBO analyst Edward Gramlich said past trade protections, first imposed in the 1950's have had only a small benefit for profits and investments of domestic firms. Trade Subcommittee chairman, Rep. Sam Gibbons, said the agencies analyses seemed to agree with his opinion against congressional approval of protectionist textile quota legislation aimed mainly at Western Europe, Japan and other Asian textile producing countries. President Reagan last year vetoed a textile protection bill but it was reintroduced in this session of Congress and is expected to be voted on in the House this year. However, approval this year is in doubt because passage of a major trade bill without specific protections for textiles showed a weakening of support for the legislation. Most U.S. producers have fallen behind other foreign producers in the use of modern textile and apparel production equipment and net imports are growing faster than the domestic markets, Kelly said. He added that private investment in the textile and clothing industry in 1983 of 0.5 pct was less than one-seventh the average manufacturing investment of 3.9 pct. Despite existing import quotas and tariffs, imports of textiles grew 26 pct in 1986 and imports of apparel grew 14 pct while U.S. production rose only 1.9 pct. \"The traditional industry seems destined to be replaced by new technology, imports, or some combination of both.

In an interview with Reuters, Durham said the company was examining potential candidates but not yet talking with any. He declined to name the companies but said a deal could occur as soon as the second half of 1987. Phelps Dodge, which ranks as the largest copper producer in the U.S., last year paid 240 mln dlrs for Columbian Chemicals Co, a maker of carbon black which is used in rubber and tires among other products. The purchase was part of a strategic plan to diversify and eventually match earnings from non-copper operations and copper operations. Phelps Dodge could spend between 250 mln and 500 mln dlrs to buy another non-copper company, Durham said, citing about 100 mln dlrs of cash and 580 mln dlrs of untapped bank credit. Any acquisition candidate would have to have a different economic cycle than copper, substantial earnings and good management, he said. Phelps Dodge would only want a friendly deal, he added. \"We're not talking high-tech, or financial services or about a perfume company,\" he said. \"We want a good basic industrial company that will fit into our management structure,\" Durham said. During the interview, Durham and other executives also said continued strong demand and tight copper supply should lead to higher prices for the metal. \"In my view, it's not a matter of if but when the price (for copper) will improve because there aren't that many new projects coming on, and demand, short of a major recession, will continue to grow modestly,\" said executive vice president Douglas Yearley.

U.S. beef sales to Japan, currently around 480 mln dlrs annually, could increase to over two billion dlrs and as high as six billion dlrs by the year 2000 if Japanese quotas were removed and the Japanese consumer were made more aware of the attributes of U.S. beef, officials of the U.S. Meat Export Federation said at a press conference today. Partially funded with a 6.5 mln dlr award made through the Agriculture Department's Targeted Export Assistance (TEA) program, a five-year meat promotion campaign in Japan was launched by the U.S. Meat Export Federation in April. \"The promising Japanese beef market could be one of the bright spots for U.S. agricultural exports,\" said Philip Seng, Asian Director for the Federation. \"We supply and they (Japan) buy a very high quality of beef. They like our beef and want to buy more,\" he said. Seng pointed to Japan's beef quota system, which limits total Japanese beef imports to 177,000 tonnes per year and U.S. imports to 58,400 tonnes, as the major constraint in expanding U.S. beef shipments to Japan. The quotas were implemented in 1977 at a time of heavy Japanese foreign beef imports. The current quota agreement expires next March and beef quota negotiations are set to get underway this fall. The Reagan administration has called for an end to the quotas by April, 1988, but Japanese officials have said they would not liberalize imports regardless of the U.S. pressure. Officials from the Meat Export Federation told Reuters that they do not expect a complete lifting of the quota, but that they hope for at least a gradual increase in the quota. High beef prices in Japan caused by the protected market has also kept beef consumption at modest levels, meat industry officials said. Japanese shoppers pay an average of 27.14 dlrs for a U.S. tenderloin steak in a restaurant and an average of 47.42 dlrs for a Japanese-produced restaurant steak, the meat association said. At the retail level, U.S. striploin sells for 9.77 dlrs per pound, while Japanese beef sells for 28.51 dlrs per lb. Japanese consumers currently eat less than 10 lbs of beef per year, compared to 78 lbs for the average American, officials said.

Contrary to predictions before the Volcker resignation, analysts are calling for higher currency futures prices between now and the June 8 Venice economic summit. In particular, uncertainty about Greenspan's attitude to the dollar could undermine sentiment toward the U.S. currency, analysts said. Greenspan said today that the dollar appeared to be nearing a bottom, but the market will bear in mind his remarks in Chicago last week that the dollar's recent move upward was a technical reaction and that it would trade significantly lower, analysts said. \"Disappointment of European central bankers over the appointment will be used as an opportunity to sell the dollar lower,\" said Manufacturers Hanover Futures vice president Carol Mackoff. \"The international community will not like this appointment,\" as it suggests the possibility that the U.S. budget deficit is too much of a burden on monetary policy and that Volcker was unable to get the commitment he sought to reduce the deficit, added Merrill Lynch Economics analyst David Horner. Furthermore, \"that Greenspan was not named two months ago suggests that he was not the Administration's first choice -- and that the status of his appointment was as a bridesmaid,\" Horner said. A declining dollar scenario with higher currency futures prior to and throughout the Venice meetings would be mitigated only by concrete action as opposed to \"jawboning\" at the G-7 summit, he said. But G-7 finance ministers, judged by recent statements, may be at an impasse, analysts said. Japan and West Germany today reiterated that neither planned further interest rate cuts, despite pressure from the U.S. to do so, Mackoff said. The U.S., on the other hand, has not cut its budget deficit as Japan and West Germany have urged, she said. Should G-7 members force a U.S. commitment to cut its budget deficit in the next two years, a further decline in the dollar could be forestalled, Horner said. However, \"the impact from Venice will be nothing if nothing changes,\" Horner said.

Industry sources said latest forecasts for the 1987 crop indicated output of 360,000 tonnes, well down on the record 501,800 tonne tel quel production in the 1986 (May-December) crop year. The previous record was set in 1982 when Fiji produced 486,790 tonnes. For the past month Fiji sugar farmers have delayed harvesting the 1987 crop pending a response from the Governor-general to demands following the May 14 coup. Ganilau said in a statement the Fiji Sugar Corp would make a payment of five dlrs per tonne against the final payment for the 1986 crop on the understanding that preparations by growers for commencement of harvesting would be completed at all mills by June 23. Crushing would commence at Labasa and Penang mills on June 23 and at Lautoka and Rarawai mills on June 30, he said. The interim payment, to be made on or about June 30, is the full amount of the grower's share of 1986 sugar proceeds received to-date. The balance will be paid in October. Growers had also called for the full 1987 forecast price of 23.50 dlrs per tonne of cane to be paid in cash on delivery to the mill, but this has been rejected by the state controlled Fiji Sugar Corp, Ganilau said. However, in addition to the scheduled delivery payment of 14.10 dlrs, an additional sum of 2.35 dlrs, or 10 pct of the forecast price, would be paid on December 15, on all cane harvested by November 30, he said. Ganilau said, \"This will be at least one month in advance of the expected date of payment of the second payment of cane. The balance of the second payment will be made six weeks after the end of crushing.\" Another demand of Fiji's 22,000 small farmers was that an estimated 14 mln dlr loan from the Fiji Development Bank (FDB) for the 1983 cane crop rehabilitation programme be written off. The FDB rejected this request. Ganilau said, however, \"The bank is prepared to carefully consider requests for rescheduling loan repayments in cases of hardship on a case-by-case basis.\" In response to a further demand that all soldiers be removed from the cane growing areas, Ganilau said the army would restrict its presence in the cane areas.

However, the European coffee trade federation meeting, which began here today and is to continue to the end of the week, has revealed gaps in the European position on re-introducing quotas. Traders said that, as a whole, the trade side was against re-introduction of ICO quotas, while roasters were generally in favour with the single proviso that there had to be some formula basis for re-allocating quota shares among producing countries. The roasters said the positions were generally fairly close, and problems with some Government officials. Germany and Italy were cited as the extremes of polarized Government attitudes, with most other countries on the fence. Sources said Germany was the most extreme against quota re-introduction, while the Italians were most in favour. \"Nevertheless, we expect to find enough common ground by the end of the week to at least present a common European Community (EC) view at the next meeting of consumer members of the International Coffee Agreement (ICA) in July,\" one trader said. \"We hope we can present the compromise proposal and that not only the consumer side, but the producer side will accept it,\" one official said. \"We have learned that we can live without the quotas that were suspended in February last year, but would prefer the stability they can bring to the market as long as we do not simply return to the old and outdated status quo as far as quota allocation is concerned,\" he added. Overall, however, trader and roaster opinion on the likelihood of a successful re-negotiation was mildly pessimistic, varying between a 50-50 chance and 60-40 against. \"Our main difficulty will be to persuade the U.S. On the consumer side and Brazil on the producer side to agree to quota re-introduction, \" he said. \"The U.S. Position has, if anything, hardened, while the new Brazilian Coffee Institute president has adopted the least negotiable position of any of his predecessors,\" one trader said. \"However, with many producers starting to swing in favour of the consumer position that quotas have to be re-allocated under a new formula, Brazil is becoming increasingly isolated, which gives at least some hope of a compromise at the ICO quota meeting in September,\" the official said.", "labels": ["coffee"]}, {"id": "test/18605", "text": "FIRST DATA MANAGEMENT &lt;FDMC.O> COMPLETES MERGER First Data Management co Inc said it has completed a merger into Firsst Data MAnagement Holding co following sharehoplder approval.

The agreed cut in farm programs is a compromise between 1.4 billion sought by the Senate and one billion by the House. The negotiators also agreed to cut 1.6 billion from the farm budget in fiscal 1989 and 2.45 billion in 1990, for a total of 5.3 billion in saving over three years, sources said. The agreement presents the House and Senate Agriculture committees with difficult choices on how to make changes in agriculture programs that achieve the budget savings targets without jeopardizing popular support payments, senior Congressional aides told Reuters. Some farm state lawmakers already are manuevering to find the budget savings. Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., Chairman of the House grains subcommittee, has introduced a bill which would freeze wheat and corn loan rates for the 1988 crop at the current 2.28 dlrs and 1.92 dlrs respectively, saying it would save 500 mln dlrs. House Agriculture Committee chairman Kika De la Garza has said the committee will consider the Glickman proposal. But Congressional sources said the proposal is unlikely to be approved because of opposition from Republican lawmakers and a strong stance by Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, who said freezing loan rates would send the wrong signal to other major grain export competitors and would not achieve the budget savings Glickman claims. Another area where Glickman and other have said budget savings might be made is to increase acreage reduction program, ARP, levels for wheat and corn. However, on this issue also Lyng has taken a strong stand within the Reagan administration, arguing that the 1988 crop wheat acreage reduction should be left at 27.5 pct and not 30 pct as sought by the Office of Management and Budget, OMB. Most commodity lobbyists expect Lyng to prevail. Congressional sources said the only way to achieve significant budget cuts through ARP increases would be to boost the 1988 corn ARP. But one informed Congressional source said singling-out corn for an ARP increase would would be seen as unfair to one commodity. Congressional sources said the areas where Congress is most likely to eventually look for budget savings are some tightening of the payment limitation rules, and possible adoption of a 0/92 program for the 1988 crops of major grains. Those changes would achieve a portion of the 1.25 billion but not enough, they said. Ultimately, Congressional sources said the agriculture committees may be forced to apply an across-the-board cut on all Commodity Credit Corp. payments to farmers, including price support loans and deficiency payments, similar to the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget cut applied in fiscal 1986.

They said Nigeria, which holds the OPEC conference presidency, and Qatar probably have the biggest grievances about price differentials making some of their crudes uncompetitive. There has also been speculation by Japanese traders that OPEC might want to mark up prices of high-sulphur heavy crudes, to correspond with greater demand and higher fuel oil prices. But most experts agree that a major overhaul of price differentials is unlikely, so as to avoid giving the market signals of a dent in OPEC's new unity. \"All OPEC members can make a good case for changing differentials,\" said one analyst with a major oil company. \"But at the end of the day, the attitude is going to be \"leave well alone' and little or nothing is likely to be altered.\" Iran, Libya and Saudi Arabia are among those who also saw sales problems earlier this year, traders say. But diminished customer resistance to fixed prices and, in some cases, marketing incentives have helped their sales. Some producers can sell uncompetitively priced crudes by means of discounts, processing deals or selling them alongside better priced grades in a \"package.\" Many OPEC crudes are seen to be reasonably priced, at least for some part of the year. But many experts say OPEC should change prices quarterly or monthly to match seasonal demand for fuel oil-rich heavy crudes and gasoline-rich lighter grades. At its last meeting in December, OPEC agreed to reintroduce fixed prices from February 1 around an 18 dlr per barrel reference point. Official prices had been effectively dropped in 1985 when members offered discounts to attract customers. OPEC also decided to limit first-half 1987 output to 15.8 mln bpd and proposed ceilings of 16.6 mln for the third quarter and 18.3 mln for the fourth. Analysts expect it will now extend or raise slightly the current ceiling for the coming months. Spot market and netback values for some crudes do not mirror official prices, but OPEC will probably keep the 18 dlr target and at most make minimal changes to differentials, analysts say. The 18 dlr figure is based on a basket of six OPEC and one non-OPEC crudes. OPEC assigned prices to its other key export crudes, with a 2.65 dlr gap between the heaviest and lightest. Extra heavy crudes were among those left out. Industry estimates vary on the proportion of OPEC oil exports actually sold at official prices. Several experts say only one-quarter to one-third of the total in fact sells at official prices, with some of the rest included in processing or barter deals or sold in the form of refined products. Problems with the new structure appeared earlier this year, when some producers' output fell due to customer reluctance to pay the new prices. Nigeria especially found its gasoline-rich Bonny Light crude -- now OPEC's highest priced grade at 18.92 dlrs a barrel -- was uncompetitive on the spot market against Britain's Brent. In February and March, Nigeria's production shrank below its 1.238 mln bpd OPEC quota. Spot prices have since revived, due partly to seasonal demand for gasoline, and its output has risen. Some experts feel Bonny Light is still overvalued and say its price should be cut by between 50 cts to one dlr a barrel.

Finance Minister Roger Douglas predicted a budget surplus for the year ending March 1988 of 379 mln New Zealand dlrs against a 1.95 billion deficit last year. Analysts polled by Reuters said the forecast budget surplus was even more positive than the most bullish analysts' forecasts and that this was good news for financial markets. Market expectations among analysts questioned by Reuters before the budget varied widely between a balanced budget and a 2.3 billion dlr deficit. But none predicted a surplus. The forecast initially looks positive for both the bond and the foreign exchange markets, one analyst said. Paradoxically, the New Zealand dollar could rise in the medium term, despite lower interest rates, as overseas investors became more confident about investing in New Zealand, he said. However, some foreign exchange dealers disagreed, saying the local dollar is primarily interest rate driven and will move lower. The local dollar dropped to 0.5940/50 U.S. Dlrs in after hours trading, against 0.5970/77 just before the budget release. Analysts said the budget was also positive for the share market, despite an increase in the contribution of company taxation to revenue figures. One equities analyst predicted that the budget surplus announcement could push the share market up by 50 points tomorrow. The Budget statement was broadly as expected, with a continuation of existing policies, and the absence of traditional pre-election incentives would be viewed positively by overseas investors, another said. But one merchant bank economist said that certain anti-tax avoidance measures could damage some sectors of the share market, particularly multi-national companies. The government is also lowering its borrowing requirements, through bond tenders, as a result of the surplus. The requirement for the rest of the year is now down to 950 mln N.Z. Dlrs from a predicted 1.75 billion. Predicted revenue in the Budget looked sustainable and there appeared to be no holding back on expenditure, another economist said.

A record fall in unemployment and good manufacturing production data showed that the economy is still strong and does not need a fillip from lower rates. News that underlying earnings are rising 7.75 pct annually, taken together with higher than expected bank lending and money supply growth, revived inflation worries and monetarist arguments against easier credit, they said. \"The timetable on lower interest rates is being pushed back all the while. The strength of the economy and broad money growth are making it more difficult to see one in the near term,\" said Chase Manhattan Securities economist Robin Marshall. Analysts have reached this conclusion despite yesterday's mortgage rate cuts for new borrowers, which building societies said were a sign of the expected near term trend for U.K. Rates. It also counters the optimistic forecasts of last week that a post-general election cut was imminent, supported by such optimistic economic news as May's record reserves rise which mirrored the Bank of England efforts to cap sterling's strength. The gilt market lost nearly half a point as enthusiasm about May's 64,300 fall in the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate, to 2.95 mln or 10.6 pct of the workforce, was rapidly replaced by dismay at the continued high level of underlying average earnings in April, dealers said. The upset was compounded by news that sterling bank lending rose 2.7 billion stg in May, above forecast, and that the Bank of England looks likely to have to sell more gilts to offset the impact on domestic money supply of its current intervention. \"The gilt market reaction was correct,\" said Bill Martin, chief U.K. Economist at brokers Phillips and Drew. \"That's very important ... It shows the economy in a very good state indeed,\" Skeoch said. \"There's no reason to get worries about inflationary pressures because they're very subdued.\" Unit wage cost rises were better than expected, just one pct higher in the year to April, and it was these costs rather than average earnings which were potentially inflationary, he added. \"I don't think these average earnings numbers are a major problem,\" agreed Chase Manhattan's Marshall. But he said the gilts market was likely to remain worried about the funding implications of recent intervention. He said the inflow of foreign money into sterling assets earlier this year, attracted by growth prospects and hopes that the ruling Conservatives would win last week's election, now looks likely to prevent a base rate cut as the authorities try to prevent these funds swelling the domestic money system. However, David Owen, U.K. Economist at Kleinwort Grieveson Securities, said any fresh sterling strength would still trigger a base rate cut and that today's figures did not signal higher inflation this year. \"Wage increases are being offset by productivity growth.

Yesterday ARCO's stock jumped as much as five points on rumors it was spinning off the chemical operations. Based on about 183 mln outstanding shares, the market in its frenzy was valuing the spin-off at about 900 mln dlrs, analysts said. Atlantic Richfield, aware of the rumors, issued a statement around mid-day that it was considering a sale of only 20 pct of the unit, leading investors to take profits. After the announcement, the company's stock retreated, closing at 93-7/8, up 1-3/8. Today it was off 1/4. \"It was a smaller deal than expected and somewhat disappointing,\" said analyst George Baker at Smith Barney. He said rumors of the spin-off had been around \"for a couple of days.\" Baker said the unit was very profitable but it wasn't getting the type of exposure Atlantic Richfield sought, and its value was not reflected in the company's stock price. Industry analyst Richard Pzena of Sanford C. Bernstein said the unit had operating earnings of 132 mln dlrs last year and he expected it to earn about 175 mln dlrs this year. Based on a multiple of 17 times earnings--which Pzena says chemical companies now sell for--the entire unit is worth about three billion dlrs, putting the 20 pct interest at around 500 to 600 mln dlrs. Pzena said he thought the company was selling the stake because chemical margins had peaked, and he speculated the company would use the proceeds to pay down debt.

Norbert Tanghe, head of division of the Commission's Directorate General for Agriculture, told the 8th Antwerp Oils and Fats Contact Days \"the Commission firmly believes that the sacrifices which would be undergone by Community producers in the oils and fats sector ... Would justify asking consumers to make an appropriate contribution to solving the serious problem within that sector by paying a levy.\" The proposed tax is necessary because the level of budgetary costs resulting from olive oil and oilseeds production has become unacceptable, Tanghe said. Recent estimates put these costs at 4.0 billion European Currency Units and by 1990 they would rise by another 2.0 billion Ecus, he said. In 1990 the Community's \"standstill\" agreements with Spain and Portugal end and the EC would then feel the full impact of its enlargement. The Commission has proposed several cost and production cutting measures which include the introduction of a maximum guaranteed quantity system, he added. Under the Commission's system for stabilising consumer prices in the oils and fats sector, a reference price of 700 Ecus per tonne for refined soy oil would be introduced, Tanghe said. Consumer prices could be raised or lowered by a regulatory amount when market prices are below or above this level. He said the revenue generated by charging a regulatory amount would be used to finance the Common Agricultural Policy's oils and fats regime. \"The Commission believes that hostile reactions (to the proposed tax) have for the most part been based on incomplete or an insufficiently thorough analysis of the proposal,\" he said. Tanghe said the proposed system conforms with General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, GATT, rules. It would not be discriminatory because it would be applied to domestic and imported products, and past experience showed it would not cause any decline in consumption of oils and fats. EC-produced oilseeds would not benefit more than they do under present aid arrangements, he said. The competitiveness between different oils, whether EC produced or imported, would remain unchanged and quantities imported from third countries would not be affected by the tax, Tanghe said. The proposed system would not alter the EC nations' requirements as far as imports are concerned since the overall effect would stabilise Community production levels without affecting demand, he said. It is one of the proposal's objectives to maintain current import levels, he said. Imports of soybeans would be unaffected because they are imported primarily to satisfy the EC's cakes and meals requirements, which are not covered by the stabilising system.

He told the 8th Antwerp Oils and Fats Contact Days that in the next Oct/Sept 1987/88 season, palm oil use will rise to 8.25 mln tonnes from 7.71 mln, below the five-year average increase of 550,000 tonnes. Opening stocks at the start of next October are expected to be about 1.4 mln tonnes, 300,000 tonnes below year-earlier levels, bringing total supplies to 9.5 mln tonnes, he said. The anticipated total supplies will be about 500,000 tonnes above this season's available amount, Mielke said. The increase in mature palm tree areas in Malaysia will slow down from this year on, but that will be offset by area expansion in Indonesia, he said. He estimated the combined rise in Malaysian and Indonesian mature area at 8.7 pct next year, after 9.5 pct this year, and at 6.7 pct in 1989 and 5.0 pct in 1990. Malaysia also is shifting plantings to Sabah and Sarawak, where the rate of expansion is higher than in the Peninsula, but where yields are lower, he said. The stocks/usage ratio of seven major oils is also expected to decline, Mielke said. The oils are soybean, cottonseed, sunflowerseed, coconut, rapeseed, palmkernel and palm. At the start of October 1986 stocks of these oils were unusually high and represented 6.8 weeks of the current season's prospective demand, compared with six weeks a year ago and with 5.4 weeks in 1984, he said. Mielke expects the ratio to fall to 5.9 weeks by the start of next October and to the unusually low level of 5.4 weeks by the end of next season. The stocks/usage ratio for palm oil was 11.4 weeks last October and is likely to be 8.7 weeks next October and 7.7 at the end of next season, Mielke said. World oilseed stocks also are expected to fall in the course of the next season, with the biggest reduction seen in soybean stocks, which Mielke expects to decline by 5.0 mln tonnes or by one fifth. Almost all of the decline is expected to occur in the U.S., for which he estimated ending stocks next season at 10.7 mln tonnes, or 393 mln bushels, against anticipated ending stocks of 15 mln tonnes, or 551 mln bushels, at the end of this season.", "labels": ["coconut-oil", "cotton-oil", "palm-oil", "rape-oil", "soy-oil", "sun-oil", "veg-oil"]}, {"id": "test/18782", "text": "PAN-ALBERTA/UNITED GAS SETTLEMENT APPROVED Pan-Alberta Gas Ltd said its 1986 proposed settlement with United Gas Pipe Line Co, of Houston, received unconditional approval by the U.S. Federal Energy Regulator Commission.

Woods also said the EC was joined by the United States in criticising Brazil for extending its list of products for which import licenses have been temporarily suspended, so as to improve its balance of payments. The United States charged Japan with violating GATT rules by restricting imports of agricultural products through an import licensing system. The United States asked for consultations with Tokyo on the issue. Tran charged that the trade measures contravened a political commitment to halt and reverse trade barriers, pledged by ministers in Punta del Este last September. When ministers established the four year Uruguay round to negotiate freer trade in 13 areas, they set up the GATT surveillance body to monitor this commitment, known in GATT jargon as \"standstill and rollback.\" Tran criticised Washington for the \"superfund\" tax on oil imports, a customs user fee, and the removal of a special machine tool (known as category FSC34) from its government procurement list for reasons of national security. Warren Lavorel, a U.S. Trade official, defended the policies, saying they did not violate GATT trade rules. The surveillance body will send a record of today's talks to the Trade Negotiating Committee, which oversees the round, to decide any further action on the charges. The oil tax and customs user fee have already been the subject of formal GATT dispute panels set up outside the Uruguay Round to rule on the legality of the practices.

But Zambia's decision to abandon last May 1 a tough International Monetary Fund (IMF) economic recovery program has introduced an element of uncertainty into plans to restructure the ailing industry and boost profitability, they said. Copper production by the government-controlled Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) for the 1987 financial year ended March 31 improved slightly to about 471,000 tonnes from a record 1986 low of 463,354 tonnes. \"We are convinced that by the end of the 1988 financial year, copper production could well be over 500,000 tonnes due to greater availability of spares and equipment,\" a ZCCM official said. ZCCM officials said the production of cobalt, another strategic income earner, will also be tailored to meet demand. Finished production in 1986 was 4,565 tonnes, 911 tonnes higher than the previous year and the best production achieved to date. Protracted low world metal prices have badly hit the copper industry in Zambia, the world's fifth biggest producer. Mining is monopolised by ZCCM and accounts for about 90 pct of the country's foreign exchange earnings. Production has also been seriously affected in recent years by equipment breakdowns, deteriorating ore and shortages of spare parts, fuel and lubricants. The 463,354 tonnes output last year compared with a peak 1975 output of 700,000 tonnes. A five-year production and investment plan launched in 1984 by ZCCM is being funded by the European Community, the African Development Bank and the World Bank. The plan foresees the shutdown of some seven mining and metallurgical units on the grounds they are unprofitable. ZCCM, the second largest employer after the government, has said it intends to lay off 20,000 of its 60,000 workforce as part of the plan. More than 250 mln dlrs have so far been channelled into the industry in a bid to improve efficiency and profitability under the five-year restructuring plan. Company officials said although reserves were being depleted, Zambia could continue to produce copper beyond the end of the century, though at lower levels of production. Industry sources said ZCCM's projected pre-tax profit for the financial year ended March 31 would be around 500 mln kwacha. But with the current mineral export tax level being levied, a net loss is likely to be registered. ZCCM recorded a net loss of 718 mln kwacha in 1986 compared with a net profit of 19 mln kwacha the year before. Under the foreign exchange auction system introduced in 1985, ZCCM's profits from its foreign exchange earnings rose as the value of the kwacha fell to 21 to the dollar from just over two to the dollar. But on May 1, President Kenneth Kaunda abolished the auctioning system, inspired by the International Monetary Fund, and announced Zambia would pursue a go-it-alone economic strategy based on national resources. ZCCM officials are still cautious over what effects the break with the IMF will have on the industry's plans. \"We are still consulting to see how the new measures will affect us but it is too early to say just how we shall fare under the new situation,\" Peter Hansen, director of operations and third in the ZCCM hierarchy, told Reuters. Some analysts believe the new officially-fixed exchange rate of eight kwacha to the dollar will hit ZCCM's export profits. \"Most specialists I have talked to tell me the break-even point for ZCCM is a rate of 10 kwacha per dollar,\" Frederick Chiluba, leader of the Zambian Congress of Trade Unions said. High production costs continue to bedevil the Zambian industry. Zambia mines copper at a relatively expensive rate of 69 cents per pound, compared with 55 cents in the United States and under 40 cents in Chile. The industry also faces transport problems due to Zambia being landlocked. The government confirmed this year it had stopped sBending copper south through South Africa. Over 80 pct of shipments, some 35,000 tonnes a month, are sent by rail to the Tanzanian port of Dar-es-Salaam, while 5,000 tonnes go via Zimbabwe to the Mozambique port of Beira.

Rumors of a damaging storm in West Texas helped the New York cotton futures market rally sharply this morning. Cotton for December delivery was 1.35 cents higher at 70.95 cents a lb at midsession after peaking this morning at 71.25 cents. \"What happened is that the storm hit Lubbock airport, and when that happens, everybody sees it,\" said Dale Mohler, a senior meteorologist with Accu-Weather Inc. Lubbock is the heart of the West Texas cotton region, which produces about 80 pct of that state's crop. The storm produced winds of about 75 mph. \"That's hurricane force. But they were isolated to just a small portion of the West Texas area, probably less than five pct,\" Mohler said. \"No doubt there was some damage. But if it had hit in July or August (when fruiting would be underway) it would have been worse,\" Mohler said. About 60 pct of the West Texas cotton crop has been planted, and the remainder could be done by the weekend if weather remains hot and dry, Stichler said.

Although net exports will add 0.7 pct to GNP this year, after reducing it by 1.2 pct in 1986, consumer spending will contribute 1.4 pct less to GNP than it did last year. As a result, GNP this year is likely to expand a modest 2.5 pct, the same rate as last year, according to Daniel Van Dyke, the Bank of America economist who wrote the report. \"Growth in consumer spending in the United States will drop dramatically this year because the jump in inflation will cause a falloff in the growth of disposable income,\" Van Dyke said. Growth in U.S. consumer spending is likely to slow to 1.8 pct this year from 4.1 pct in 1986, he predicted. The report was released before the Commerce Department reported today that personal income rose just 0.2 pct in May, after increasing 0.4 pct in April, and that personal consumption expenditures had risen just 0.1 pct, compared with a 0.6 pct increase the month before. The rising cost of energy and imports is likely to boost consumer prices by an average of 3.7 pct this year, up from 1.9 pct in 1986, Bank of America forecast. This rise in inflation will reduce real disposable income growth to only 1.3 pct in 1987 from 2.9 pct in 1986. As a result, Van Dyke calculated that the purchasing power of an average family of four will increase by a modest 540 dlrs this year compared to a surge of 1,210 dlrs during 1986. The slowdown in income growth is likely to cause housing starts to drop by 4.2 pct this year and a further six pct in 1988 to an annual rate of 1.63 mln units. \"For the first time in several years, a recession in 1988 or 1989 is more than a remote possibility,\" Van Dyke said.

Brooklyn Union, the fourth largest gas utility in the United States, purchased 36 pct of its supplies on the spot, or non-contract, market in 1986, and the proportion of spot supplies was estimated much higher in the five months of 1987, analysts said. Texas Eastern pipelines &lt;TET>, the other competing pipeline, to deliver spot gas from producing areas in the South closed its gate station for summer, and Brooklyn Union has relied entirely on Transco for spot supplies. In the month of May, Brooklyn Union paid about two dlrs per mln British Thermal Unit for spot gas, while contract gas costs four to five dlrs per mln BTU, industry sources said. Transco announced yesterday it would no longer provide open access to transport spot natural gas to its customers for fear of accumulating more take-or-pay liabilities. Take-or-pay contracts oblige pipelines to pay producers for gas even if delivery is not taken by its customers. Brooklyn Union will continue receiving a small amount of supplies from minor fields under a grandfather clause, a Brooklyn Union official said. Foster Corwith, gas analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said most of the rising cost to Booklyn Union will be passed through to rate payers. While net effect on the company will not be known for several months because of the time lag in deferred earnings, end-users, especially residential and commercial customers, will end up paying more for gas, he said. Because the closure takes place in summer months when gas demand is at seasonal low, the impact on cash flow would be small, Curt Launer, natural gas analyst with Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette, said. If the situation persists into winter heating season, high cost gas could cut in the company's profits, he said. Gas utilities along eastern seaboard relying on Transco for spot gas, such as North Carolina Natural Gas Co &lt;NCNG>, Piedmont Natural Gas Co &lt;PNY>, will face the same high cost factor as Brooklyn Union, Steve Richards, a supply manager with end users supply system, a Houston based natural gas brokering firm, said. \"But these companies are not unwitting victims of the take-or-pay dispute between Transco and producers,\" he said. Distributors have turned a deaf ear to Transco's request for an inventory charge, which reserves the pipeline facility for spot gas to be delivered to these companies, he said. Without spot supplies, the high cost of system gas will threaten to drive away large customers capable of shifting to alternative fuels, he said. In absence of any guidelines on inventory charges from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the matter is being negotiated between pipelines and customers, Richards said. Now that Transco has refused to transport cheap spot gas for them, these distributors are likely to be more conciliatory on the inventory charge, he said. \"Cool heads will prevail,\" DLJ's Launer said, \" but it may take a while.\"", "labels": ["nat-gas"]}, {"id": "test/18920", "text": "REYNOLDS METALS &lt;RLM> TO RESTART IDLE POTLINE Reynolds Metals co said it plans to restart the last idle potuction line at its Troutdale, Ore., primary aluminum plant.

Several hours before a regularly scheduled board of directors meeting, Gillette disclosed that Perelman requested consent of its board for an offer of at least 40.50 dlrs per share. Perelman needed the consent because he agreed in November not to buy stock for 10 years without permission. \"I think Ronald Perelman is less interested in Gillette and more interested in putting Gillette into play because he stands to make a ton of money,\" said Andrew Shore, analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. \"In play\" is a term used on Wall Street to describe what happens when a company becomes an unwiling takeover target. Shore noted that according to the 1986 agreement Revlon gets paid if there is any acquisition of Gillette through November of this year at a price higher than 29.75 dlrs per share. Gillette rose three to 40 today, following a gain of three yesterday. The agreement would be calculated on the basis of Perelman's previous holding of 18.4 mln shares, adjusted for a split. For example, a deal between Gillette and some other company at 44 dlrs per share would make Revlon richer by 262 mln dlrs under the formula. Neither Perelman nor his spokesmen returned telephone calls seeking comment. \"Revlon stands to make a substantial amount of money if someone else takes over Gillette,\" said Analyst Deepak Raj of Merrill Lynch and Co. \"I'm not saying that is going to happen but Gillette is an undervalued stock with a breakup value of 45 dlrs per share.\" Shore of Shearson Lehman said there are a couple of reasons why Perelman may not be really interested in acquiring Gillette. He said Perelman, in the process of taking Revlon private after acquiring control of the cosmetics company two years ago, probably wants to concentrate on improving Revlon's operations. \"He's trying to overhaul and improve the image of the dearptment store business.\" Another reason is that Revlon has recently made two other acquisitions. Under those circumstances, Shore would not be surprised if some company such as Unilever plc &lt;UN.AS> or Procter and Gamble Co &lt;PG> decided to take a look at Gillette. Shore mentioned half a dozen other potential buyers for Gillette including Sir James Goldsmith, Hanson Trust plc &lt;HAN>, RJR Nabisco Inc &lt;RJR>, American Brands Inc &lt;AMB> and Ralston Purina Co &lt;RAL>. \"Perelman is trying to put the company in play,\" said a Wall Street arbitrageur. \"He gets to share in the upside if the company is sold.\" Another arbitrageur said he expects Gillette to resist Perelman's overture. \"I can't see the board consenting, what has changed between November and now,\" he said. Another arbitrageur said he was not sure what was going on. \"Perelman never does anything without a fair amount of calculation,\" he said. But he added, \"The Gillette board has to be careful. They just can't say no or they'll be sued by shareholders.\" Gillette's board was still meeting at 1700 EDT, three and one-half hours after the scheduled starting time.

The Harkin proposal would set loan rates of 5.17 dlrs per bushel for wheat, 3.77 dlrs for corn and 9.32 dlrs for soybeans, all to be put in effect under strict controls on planted acreage reductions. Present loan rates are 2.28 dlrs for wheat, 1.92 for corn, and effectively 4.56 for soybeans. Also under the plan, the U.S. would seek a world market sharing cartel with the European Community and other exporting nations, to share-out export markets, Harkin said during the first of several Senate Agriculture subcommittee hearings examining farm programs. Harkin made the following claims in testimony on his \"Family Farm Act.\" -- The mandatory control bill would increase farm income and reduce government spending on agriculture. -- Harkin said his policy of high price supports would not ruin U.S. agricultural exports as critics claim, but would increase overall revenue from exports. This would be done by seeking agreement among major exporting countries including the European Community on market sharing at agreed high prices. Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo., countered during the hearing that such a grain export cartel is not workable. -- Harkin acknowledged that higher commodity price supports would be passed onto consumers, but he said high food prices stem more from \"gouging\" by food processing companies than from high farm product prices.

He said as a transition to the higher prices, he would allow livestock producers to purchase Commodity Credit Corp. grain stocks for three years. Thereafter, livestock farmers would benefit from a \"predictable and stable\" grain price, he said. -- Harkin said that under his policy approach farm participation would be no more \"mandatory\" than the current farm program.

This view is less favourable than the West German government's forecast of a growth rate of under two pct this year, but is in line with forecasts by independent economic institutes of growth ranging from 1.5 to two pct.

While noting that the government is bringing forward a five billion mark tax reform to January 1988, the OECD said that \"the medium to longer-term performance of the West German economy could be improved by reduction of subsidies - which would allow relatively lower tax rates.\" Since the OECD report was compiled, the West German Federal Statistics Office has released figures showing that the GNP actually fell 0.5 pct in real terms in the first quarter of this year compared with the final three months of 1986.

The U.S. put a deadline on the talks of October 1, but both sides have said an agreement is likely despite tough bargaining remained. Niskanen said if no pact is reached, bilateral trade ties could deteriorate because of Congressional pressure on President Reagan to implement trade laws more aggressively, and this could hit some Canadian trade practices. He noted Canada is seeking foreign investment in its auto industry, which could put strains on the considerable bilateral free trade in U.S. and Canadian autos and parts. Niskanen also said the Canadian government is vulnerable to a resurgence of economic nationalism which could restrict U.S. exports to Canada. A free trade pact, backed by President Reagan and Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, would open new markets for Canada and enable its industries to achieve economies of scale, which would also help it widen exports worldwide, he said.

But private sector confidence had been undermined by uncertainties over exchange rates, it said, and warned that \"for confidence to be restored, it is important for governments swiftly to implement internationally-agreed commitments.\" This was a clear reference to last February's Louvre accord of the Group of Five nations plus Canada, analysts said.

But they also said that if money supply growth remains weak, as this week's unexpected eight billion dlr M-1 decline suggests it may, this could influence the Fed to loosen its credit reins and move toward a more accommodative monetary policy. A Reuter survey of 17 money market economists produced a forecast of a 600 mln dlr M-1 decline for the week ended June 8, with estimates ranging from a gain of one billion dlrs to a decline of four billion. Instead, M-1 fell eight billion dlrs to 745.7 billion dlrs at a seasonally adjusted annual rate. Coming on the heels of a 4.3 billion decrease in M-1 for the week ended June 1, this means the nation's money supply has fallen more than 12 billion dlrs in the past two weeks, economists said. \"M-1 has hit an air pocket of weakness,\" said Bill Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. While M-1 may have lost its significance as an indicator of economic growth, Sullivan said Fed officials might be concerned the latest drop in M-1 means another month of sluggish growth in the broader monetary aggregates, M-2 and M-3, which are seen as better gauges of economic growth. Latest monthly M-2 and M-3 data showed that as of May, both measures were growing at rates below the bottom of the Fed's 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 pct target ranges. If money growth does not accelerate, Fed officials, concerned that this indicates economic growth is flagging, could turn toward easier monetary policy, economists said. \"Does this mean that the Fed abandons its current open market position? No,\" Sullivan said. \"But does this mean the end of tightening for the time being? Definitely yes.\" Economists said average adjusted discount window borrowings of 385 mln dlrs for the latest two-week bank statement period were lower than they had expected. Most believed the Fed had targetted a two-week borrowings average of around 500 mln dlrs. But they said that if it had not been for a large one-day net miss in the Fed's reserve projections, the higher borrowings target would probably have been reached. A drop in May U.S. Housing starts and continued weakness in auto sales show key sectors of the U.S. Economy are lagging, while a recent modest 0.3 pct gain in May producer prices has helped dispel inflation fears, Slifer said. \"If this continues, we can entertain the notion of Fed easing at some point,\" he said. Other economists said the Fed would probably pay little attention to weak money supply growth. \"It has been a number of years since M-1 has given good signs of what's going on in the economy,\" one said. \"I don't think M-1 shows that the economy is falling apart and the Fed should ease.\" Economists agreed a stable dollar will continue to be a prerequisite for any move by the Fed toward easier monetary policy. They said the Fed is reluctant to lower short-term rates for fear this would spur expectations of a weaker dollar and higher inflation which would push up long-term yields and choke off econmomic growth. But Sullivan said the dollar has been steady since late April. \"The Fed has to determine if this represents a fundamental change for the dollar.

Central bank governor Chang Chi-Cheng told reporters the reserves rose only about 500 mln U.S. Dlrs in the past two weeks and the local dollar appreciated more slowly against the U.S. Dollar. Chang said, \"The pace of increase in our reserves is much slower now than before and our currency is getting more stable.\" He said the reserves, mainly the result of the trade surplus with the U.S., Rose at the rate of two to three billion U.S. Dlrs a month between January and May. The reserves, the world's third largest after Japan and West Germany, now total well over 60 billion U.S. Dlrs. On June 2 the central bank froze overseas borrowings of local and foreign banks and cut the limit on central bank purchases of forward U.S. Dollars from banks to 40 pct from 90 pct of the value of a contract. Local and foreign bankers said the June 2 measures had drastically limited their ability to lend foreign exchange to importers and exporters. They said their overseas borrowings and forward dollar transactions showed a drastic decline with some banks registering a fall of up to 30 pct. Bank dealers said the Taiwan dollar has stabilised against the U.S. Currency this week after rising two to five Taiwanese cents a day between June 2 and 13 compared with a rise of five to eight cents in May. The bank dealers said the central bank, which had previously bought U.S. Dollars heavily, sold at least 1.1 billion U.S. Dlrs in the past two weeks to meet commercial demand. They said they expected the government to keep the local dollar stable in the near term to give breathing space to businesses experiencing slower exports because of the rise of more than 23 pct in the value of the Taiwan dollar since September 1985.

Aramco, responsible for all Saudi production except about 200,000 barrels per day (bpd) in the Neutral Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, increased production to 4.69 mln barrels per day in 1986 from 3.04 mln barrels a year earlier. Most of 1986 was a virtual free-for-all in production, as OPEC members abandoned restraint in an effort to recapture their share of the market. In the process, prices collapsed from about 28 dlrs a barrel to below nine dlrs, until the organisation decided to cut production again from last September onwards.

Production of natural gas liquids in 1986 declined slightly to 304,178 bpd from 316,310, said the report, carried on the official Saudi Press Agency. The increase in reserves came despite a sharp cut in the number of wells Aramco drilled to 33 in 1986 from 103 in 1985.

And with mortgage rates now at their lowest levels in years, the loans have been snapped up by eager home buyers trying to lock into cheap money. The decision to offer fixed rate loans, industry officials said, reflects the increasingly competitive nature of the home mortgage business. While fixed rate mortgages are uncommon in the U.K., They were the mainstay of the business in the U.S. Up until only a few years ago. But in the early 1980s interest rates soared. U.S. Lenders, mostly savings and loan associations, were earning rates as low as three pct on 30 year fixed rate mortgages they held in their portfolios but had to pay depositors rates as high as 15 pct to induce them to retain their accounts. As a result hundreds of institutions collapsed or were forced to merge. The survivors decided to offer mortgages whose rates would move in line with the cost of funds. \"We very much have the example of the U.S. Thrifts in mind,\" said a spokesman for Abbey National Building Society, explaining why his institution, for the time being, is only offering variable rate mortgages. The rash of advertising to solicit new business has helped homebuyers to become even choosier about loans and lenders concede they are being forced to undercut each other still more. Sharp cuts on variable rate mortgages announced earlier this week by the nation's two largest building societies and by National Westminster Bank Plc reflect growing competition for new business, officials at all three institutions said. The fixed rate mortgages on offer carry interest rates even below those on the variable rate loans. \"Of course they are less profitable than other (variable rate) mortgages,\" said a spokesman for Midland Bank Plc, which earlier this year said it earmarked 500 mln dlrs for fixed rate new mortgage loans. But he said the bank is willing to offer less profitable loans because, \"It was just another way to attract people to our mortgage product.\" Trustee Savings Bank Plc (TSB) was offering five year fixed rate mortgages at 9.9 pct earlier this year. The 100 mln stg that TSB set aside for the loans was exhausted within just a few days, according to a spokeswoman. \"Everybody loves an under 10 pct mortgage,\" she said, noting that within five days the bank loaned the equivalent of 25 pct of its 1986 volume. In short, the appeal of fixed rate mortgages is that they offer an opportunity to gamble on the direction of interest rates. If interest rates fall after the mortgage is made the lender is earning an above average return on assets. But if interest rates rise it is the homebuyer who has won the benefit of cheap money. Household Mortgage Co had planned to offer a 25 year fixed rate mortgage after the June 11 elections on the assumption that a Conservative Party victory would help money market rates fall further, according to Duncan Young, managing director. Young explained that the company had planned to protect itself against the chance of rising interest rates by buying a complicated hedging instrument. But money market rates have risen contrary to expectations and the company has shelved its plans for the time being. He said money market rates were too high to arrange both the mortgages and hedge profitably. However, he said that when the Household Mortgage Co does make fixed rate mortgages it is likely to securitise them. This means bundling different mortgages together to resemble a bond and selling them to an investor. For technical reasons securitisation is simpler and more efficient with fixed rate rather than with floating rate mortgages. In the U.S., Where fixed rate mortgages are popular again, securitisation has provided the bulk of mortgage money over the past few years.", "labels": ["interest"]}, {"id": "test/19193", "text": "TEXACO &lt;TXC> CANADA TO RAISE CRUDE OIL POSTINGS Texaco Inc's Texaco Canada said it will raise postings for its Edmonton/Swann Hills crude by 24 canadian cts a barrel, effective June 20.

They said prices, which have steadily climbed since the organization's accord in December, have risen on technical factors within the market and concerns about supplies because of the Iran-Iraq war, which could disrupt deliveries from the Gulf. The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate is trading around 20.55 dlrs in the July contract on New York Mercantile Exchange's energy futures and in the spot market. That is its highest level since January 1986. OPEC conference president Rilwanu Lukman, who is Nigeria's oil minister, said Friday he expects the meeting in Vienna to be brief and calm and that OPEC's current price and production agreement may only need a slight review. Although most industry experts expect just a reaffirmation of the December agreement, oil prices continue to climb due to a desire to hedge positions in case of any surprises. Analysts expect the higher prices to continue until soon after the OPEC meeting. At that point, barring any increased tension in the Gulf or changes in OPEC's policies, prices should begin easing. \"OPEC will probably not do anything it hasn't already agreed to in December because oil prices are firm,\" said John Hill, a vice president at Merrill Lynch Futures. OPEC agreed in December to maintain official oil prices at 18 dlrs a barrel and raise the group's production ceiling to 16.6 mln barrels per day in the third quarter and to 18.3 mln barrels in the fourth quarter. This agreement helped send prices sharply higher, rising from 15 dlrs a barrel in early December. Several OPEC members who are price hawks, including Iran, Algeria and Libya, will seek a higher official price and a reduction in output. \"And if U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude continues to trade above 20 dlrs a barrel, there is a greater chance that OPEC will raise its official 18 dlrs price,\" said Nauman Barakat, analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co. But most analysts expect the more moderate producers, such as Saudi Arabia, to block any changes in policy. \"The meeting will be a non-event with no change in the official prices because OPEC, and in particular the Saudis, are committed to stabilizing the market,\" said Rosario Ilacqua, analyst with L.F. Rothschild. However, some analysts said OPEC may need to hold a meeting in September to re-evaluate market conditions. Overproduction by OPEC will become a real problem in the fourth quarter when the quota is raised to 18.3 mln barrels a day and Iraq's pipeline through Turkey brings another 500,000 barrels to the market each day, said John Lichtblau, president of Petroleum Industry Ressearch Foundation. Most expect Saudi Arabia to oppose a price increase at this meeting but many look for an increase by year-end to 20 dlrs to offset the decline in the dollar. Oil prices are denominated throughout the world in dollars, so as the currency declines, producers receive less money for their oil. \"The only real production restraint in OPEC is Saudi Arabia,\" said Sanford Margoshes, analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers. \"In the second half of the year we expect the Saudis not to produce at their 4.1 mln barrel a day quota and therefore act as a vehicle to stablize the market and pave the way for a two dlrs a barrel price increase at the December 1987 meeting,\" he said. One uncertain factor is the course of the Iran-Iraq war. \"The wild card is the increased tensions in the Persian Gulf,\" said Frank Knuettel, analyst with Prudential-Bache Securites. Oil tankers taking oil from Iraq and Kuwait have been regular targets for Iranian planes. The Reagan administration is planning to put Kuwait tankers under the protection of the U.S. flag, with naval escorts. \"Extra (oil) inventories are needed during a time of crisis like this, and just general nervousness over an incident that could disrupt oil supplies drives prices up,\" Knuettel said.", "labels": ["crude"]}, {"id": "test/19286", "text": "N.Y.

Under a 1985 agreement with the now-defunct U.S. Synthetic Fuels Corp, Unocal said it would study using the technology at the oil shale plant. In return the company would have been eligible for 500 mln dlrs in loan gaurantees and price supports from the U.S. Treasury Department, which took over the contract from the Synthetic Fuels Corp, Unocal said.

The fluidized bed facility would have provided heat and electricity for the oil shale project, Unocal said.

Clark told a meeting of the Minerals Research Organisation in Milton Keynes he foresaw a 250,000 ounce increase in consumption for use in autocatalysts, currently the largest single application for platinum.

Van Horick, who is a council member of the European Coffee Federation, was speaking at the end of the ECF annual meeting. The new formula is based on six-year moving averages and would give Brazil, the world's biggest coffee producer, an unchanged quota for the remaining two years of the current coffee agreement, van Horick said. If accepted by the consumer and producer members of the ICO, the formula could also be a basis for negotiating a new agreement, van Horick said. Coffee quotas were suspended in February last year when prices shot up on fears of a drought-induced crop disaster in Brazil. Although prices are now considerably lower, consumers and producers have been unable to agree on re-introduction. \"Brazil has been the most strongly against any change in the formula because it feared a lower quota. But our proposal leaves it very little to object to,\" van Horick said. \"The existing quota system is far too rigid and does not reflect supply and demand reality,\" he said. \"Our formula builds flexibility into the system and will benefit almost everyone.\" Although full implications of the new formula have still to be worked out, initial estimates suggest countries such as Colombia, Kenya, Indonesia and Costa Rica would get slightly higher quotas, while others such as the Ivory Coast, El Salvador and Nicaragua would lose quota share, van Horick said. Because the proposal provides that future quota distribution must reflect current demand and actual supply, it should also prevent under-shipment of quota as countries doing so would automatically prejudice their following year's quota. \"If the ICO consumers accept our proposal it stands at least a fair chance of being accepted by the producers at the September meeting, most of whom are generally in favour of a new quota formula, \" van Horick said. At the same time much will depend on Brazil's attitude. \"Brazil is increasingly isolated on the producer side.

Lim, in Brussels on a tour of Europe and America, said he had instructed Malaysia's representatives on the executive committee of the Association of Tin Producing Countries, ATPC, to draw up a paper on the matter. Lim earlier met European Community farm commissioner Frans Andriessen and industry commissioner Karl-Heinz Narjes. He said though it now appeared likely Commission proposals for a tax on vegetable and marine oils and fats would be defeated, he feared the Commission would revive the idea. Lim noted Andriessen this week promised that if the tax was adopted and third countries suffered export losses as a result, they would be compensated through access to the EC for alternative exports. \"Since most of our products are commodity based, I cannot see how this would work out in our case,\" Lim said. Malaysian palm oil exports to the EC are worth about 250 mln dlrs a year. The tin research proposal would be presented at an ATPC meeting to be held in Kuala Lumpur in September. \"Not enough research and development effort has been put in by tin producers and we have been pushed out by substitutes such as aluminium, paper and plastics,\" Lim said. He mentioned the use of inorganic tin in pesticides as an exciting possible new application. Lim said he could not estimate the amount of extra money which needed to be spent on research into new uses before the new paper was produced. He said Narjes told him there appeared no fundamental barriers to EC states quickly ratifying the new International Rubber Agreement, INRA, although translations of the accord into some EC languages are still being awaited. Lim, who will sign and ratify the agreement on Malaysia's behalf when he visits New York during his current tour, said it was important there should not be a long \"interregnum\" between the old agreement lapsing in October and the new one coming into force. He described the present accord as a model for commodity agreements due to its being signed by nearly all producing and consuming countries and by virtue of its review systems and control over buffer stock management.", "labels": ["alum", "palm-oil", "tin", "veg-oil"]}, {"id": "test/19368", "text": "VR &lt;VRBB.O> CLOSES STOCK SALE TO VR ACQUISITION VR Business Brokers Inc said it closed the sale of a controlling interest in its comon and preferred stock to VR Acquisition Corp, a Delaware corporation controlled by an investment group led by C.

Congressional observers say the bills are aimed mainly at Japan, Taiwan, South Korea and a few other nations with large, annual trade surpluses with the United States. Mexico, Brazil and Venezuela are the only Latin nations with large trade surpluses last year with the United States, but even Mexico, with the largest, had a surplus of only 5.2 billion dlrs, against Japan's of 58.6 billion dlrs. The European Community has also opposed the bills. Rodriguez said the Latin and Caribbean nations backed the Reagan Administration's opposition to many of the sections in the legislation, including those to curb imports and to require retaliation for foreign unfair trade practices. He told reporters the committee would likely mount a campaign to fight the legislation when it comes up for debate on the Senate floor, expected next week. Rodriguez said \"the region needs trade to continue development.

David Ruder, a 58-year-old Republican law professor at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., was named Thursday to be the 23rd chairman of the five-member U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. If confirmed by the Senate, as expected, he will succeed John Shad, who left the agency earlier this week after a record six years as chairman to become ambassador to the Netherlands. The SEC has been in the limelight for the past year as its investigators have probed into the most colossal insider trading scandal ever uncovered on Wall Street. The investigation, which is still active, mushroomed in recent months as a growing number of well known traders and prominent investment banking firms have been charged with wrongdoing. The pace of the probe picked up markedly in November after Ivan Boesky, one of Wall Street's most successful stock speculators, agreed to cooperate with government investigators and to pay a record 100 mln dlrs in penalties and illegal profits after being charged with insider trading. But the agency is also wrestling with a vexing new phenomenon of huge and rapid swings in stock prices, spurred by computer-driven trading strategies that span markets in securities, options and futures. The price gyrations have combined with rising trading volumes to bring unprecedented volatility to some U.S. securities markets. At the same time, the SEC is being pressed by some lawmakers to put a stop to abusive tactics in corporate takeover contests as an unrelenting wave of such takeovers steadily reshapes the U.S. corporate landscape. And the agency is being pushed by U.S. and foreign exchanges intent on expansion to lay the regulatory groundwork for an international securities marketplace in which trading occurs across borders throughout the world, around the clock. Such worldwide trading networks offer vast new investment opportunities but could strain the SEC's ability to enforce U.S. securities laws and guard investors from fraud. Under the leadership of Shad, the SEC eased financial disclosure requirements for publicly traded companies, eliminated many minor investor protection rules, attempted to spur competition among exchanges and streamlined the agency's review of hostile corporate takeovers. Shad, who had been vice chairman of the E. F. Hutton investment banking firm, brought a Wall Street perspective to the agency upon being named chairman in 1981. In line with the views of other top administration officials, he favored marketplace determination of takeover battles over new federal regulations. The SEC under Shad also stressed prosecution of insider trading violations over the corporate wrongdoing cases that topped the agency's enforcement agenda during the administration of President Jimmy Carter, a Democrat. Securities lawyers and industry officials acquainted with Ruder say the new chairman-designate is unlikely to significantly alter the commission's current priorities. The SEC currently has about 2,000 employees, most of them lawyers, and an annual budget of about 115 mln dlrs though that figure likely will be significantly higher next year as the agency moves to beef up its enforcement staff. The agency is one of the few in the government that actually has taken in more money than it has spent in the past few years because of fees it charges public companies, investment banks and other securities firms it regulates. The SEC is structured as an independent regulatory agency, meaning that its five commissioners are appointed by the president to fixed five-year terms and protected from firing for policy differences alone. By law, no more than three commissioners may be of the same political party, and the agency prepares its own budget request each year instead of leaving this to the White House. Established by Congress in 1934, the SEC traces its origins to the great stock market crash of 1929, which was attributed in large part to widespread trading on credit and attempted market manipulations by large investment firms. The agency requires public companies and investment vehicles such as mutual funds to issue periodic reports on their financial condition and to disclose changes in their condition any time they issue new securities. It requires brokers, dealers and investment banks to register with it and comply with investor protection rules, and it polices exchanges and regulates trading practices. Its first chairman was Joseph Kennedy, an industrial magnate who was also the father of John Kennedy, later to become the nation's 35th president. Other former chairmen include William Douglas, who served from 1937 until his appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1939, and William Casey, who served during President Nixon's first term and was Reagan's director of the Central Intelligence Agency until his death earlier this year.", "labels": ["acq"]}, {"id": "test/19433", "text": "U.S. ASKS CONGRESS TO REVISE TARIFF CATEGORIES The Administration asked Congress to replace the U.S. tariff schedule with a new system to bring it into line with international tariff categories, U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said.

Growth will slow sharply in the next months due to weakness in the key housing and auto sectors and could be further hampered unless consumer spending picks up, they say. \"These factors raise the question: Is there enough strength to keep the economy from tipping into a recession?\" said Lyle Gramley, chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers Association and a former Federal Reserve Board official. The Commerce Department said this week that the economy grew by a robust 4.8 pct annual rate in the first quarter, but a U.S. monetary official called it a weak report. Housing starts fell 2.7 pct in May, and consumer spending rose a weak 0.1 per cent. \"Our two largest visible industries -- autos and housing -- are faltering, but exports are picking up some of the slack, \" Martin Mauro, senior economist for Merrill Lynch Economics, told Reuters. Gramley said he is worried that consumer spending may slow because inflation is rising faster than real wages. To offset this, U.S. exports must continue to rise, returning enough jobs to the manufacturing sector to boost personal income and consumption, he says. \"I expect to see enough improvement in real net exports to keep a recession from happening, but it is a close call,\" Gramley said. Federal Reserve Board Governor Martha Seger told reporters that the apparent strength in the 4.8 pct growth figure was the result of a temporary buildup in inventories that will not last and said the recovery was showing anemia. Seger said that with the recovery stumbling along, \"The pace of the economy and the lack of robustness must be factored into monetary policy\" - possibly a signal that the Fed will be accommodative. Most economists predict growth slower than the 3 pct forecast by the Reagan administration for 1987 and warn that if the dollar drops suddenly, higher inflation will result and add to the risk of a recession. Mauro said a 0.5 pct rise in industrial production in May came despite cutbacks in output in the auto industry, where an inventory overhang still exists. He says the boost in production came from smaller industries like paper, chemicals, and lumber which have improved sales overseas due to the drop in the dollar. \"They are not going to be enough for any kind of surge in economic activity, but I think they will keep us out of a recession,\" Mauro said. In a speech to financial planners this week, Beryl Sprinkel, the chief White House economic adviser, predicted the trade deficit will continue to improve. \"Prospects for continued economic growth through 1987 and into 1988 are still quite favorable,\" he said. But private economists raise concerns about a resurgence in inflation. Allen Sinai, chief economist at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., told Congress this week that inflation would rise to 4.5 to five pct this year and stay at that level through 1989 after a 1.1 pct increase in 1986. The rise is coming from a sharply lower dollar, higher oil and energy prices and rising prices for services, he said. \"The lesson of history is that once the inflation genie gets out of the bottle, it continues to persist,\" he said, adding he would like the Fed to tighten credit. A major factor affecting inflation is the value of the dollar, which should continue to fall and feed inflation, says a prominent international banker. Rainer Gut, chairman of Credit Suisse, told the National Press Club that the dollar's downward trend against the yen and the mark will continue for years because the United States is the world's largest debtor nation. The Swiss banker said the economic indicators point to a further slackening of activity and called naive the belief that the five-year boom on world equity markets will go on forever. \"It is very difficult to be optimistic,\" Gut said.", "labels": ["gnp"]}, {"id": "test/19480", "text": "BRAZIL COULD EXPORT 19 MLN BAGS OF COFFEE -IBC Brazil's coffee exports could amount to 19 mln bags this year, because of the excellent crop estimate of 35.2 mln bags, an IBC spokesman said.

Kahan said recent government reports have shown strength in the economy during the first quarter, but his concern is whether the U.S. economy will sustain that strength in the longer term. Weak U.S. economic growth could hurt the dollar, which has become more important to the direction of debt futures than the beneficial impact on interest rates of a sluggish economy. The median trade expectations for Tuesday's U.S. Consumer Price Index and Durable Goods reports are up 0.4 pct and down 1.5 pct, respectively. Meanwhile, the eight billion dlr drop in the M-1 money supply announced this week was \"surprising, much larger than expected,\" according to Kahan. \"Unless quickly reversed,\" such a trend \"will ensure that June M-1 growth will be negative,\" Kahan said. Taken in conjunction with M-2 and M-3 aggregates which Kahan said have \"slowed to a crawl, below Federal Reserve Board annual targets,\" the consequences could be a hint of economic weakness down the road, he said. Based on chart formations, T-bond futures may be poised for further gains, although the advance has been slowed recently, analysts said. September T-bonds \"are up almost six points since about May 18,\" Merrill Lynch debt analyst Jim Duggan noted. September bond futures climbed from the low of 87 a month ago to over 93 in mid-June, Duggan said. While follow-through buying has aided the advance so far, and bouts of short covering have prohibited a slide through chart support, the rally in September T-bonds has been thwarted above the 93 level. \"The 93 level is formidable resistance and must be taken out before this activity is anything other than a trading range market,\" Carroll McEntee and McGinley Futures debt analyst Brian Singer said. The dollar remains the key fundamental factor, and the U.S. currency has made little headway of late, analysts said. \"The critical variable remaining in the market is the value of the dollar,\" Kahan said. Additional influences next week will be possible developments ahead of an OPEC members meeting, and the impact and size of the U.S. budget deficit, \"although these will not be in the forefront of the market early next week,\" Kahan said. In looking ahead to the U.S. Treasury mini-refunding auctions of 24.25 billion in T-notes on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, Singer said the market will likely greet the results with little excitement.

The sources said that in spite of over-production by OPEC members such as Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Qatar, demand should exceed supply by the fourth quarter. Spot oil prices surged on Friday in late U.S. Trading as the market anticipated an OPEC agreement on second-half 1987 output. In early Tokyo trade, levels were firm at 17.30 dlrs for Mideast Dubai cargoes loading next month and 19.00 dlrs for U.K. Brent, traders said. They said they expect more foreign crudes to be sucked into the U.S. Market as the benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate (WTI) trades at around 20.30 dlrs. \"With WTI at 20, 21 or 22 dlrs, U.S. Refiners will import Mideast and Far East crudes and this will strengthen those grades further,\" said a Japanese oil trader. Some Tokyo traders were cautious about whether thU spot market has further upward potential in the short term, having risen strongly on the OPEC news on Friday. \"You could certainly argue that if New York rose on that basis, there's no reason for prices to go up again today,\" said one international oil trader in Tokyo. \"But I think if there's any sign of a dip, it will be bought back up again pretty quickly,\" he added. One oil industry analyst concurred, \"There is no reason to expect a weak market from now on.\" He said he expected OPEC to raise prices to 20 dlrs when it meets on December 9. Oil sources said spot prices are unlikely to surge strongly in the next few months due to cheating by some OPEC members and the likelihood that Saudi Arabia will act as swing producer to maintain steady prices. Iraq is currently producing around two mln barrels per day compared to its second-half quota of 1.54 mln, they said. Its export capability will rise to 2.5 mln bpd when a new pipeline through Turkey, comes onstream in or around September. Qatar is said to be achieving sales of around 350,000 bpd, against its OPEC-assigned quota of 299,000, by discounting up to 20 cents a barrel from official prices, the sources said. Iran, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait are also cheating on the OPEC agreement with over-production and effective price discounts through counter-purchases, industry sources said.

The ministry had written to Norway's oil companies and would now discuss with them how best to implement the cuts. OPEC agreed this weekend in Vienna on an output ceiling of 16.6 mln barrels per day (bpd) for the rest of 1987 and retained the fixed prices that were set in its December accord based on an 18 dlr per barrel reference point. OPEC's first half 1987 output ceiling was 15.8 mln bpd, and it's December pact had provisionally set a third quarter ceiling of 16.6 mln bpd, rising to 18.3 mln in the fourth quarter. Norway, which pumps around one mln bpd from its offshore fields, previously said it would continue its output curbs from planned production for the rest of the year if OPEC remained within its December accord on output and prices. Norway's oil production rose 10 pct to an average of around 840,000 bpd in 1986. Since then it has risen to around one mln bpd, and is expected to reach about 1.5 mln bpd by 1995. The 7.5 pct cut from planned production implemented since February reduced Norway's oil output by about 80,000 bpd. Norway's Oil Minister Arne Oeien, currently in Iceland for a meeting of Nordic ministers, has made no official statement on the latest oil production cutbacks. Over the past year several other leading non-OPEC producers, including the Soviet Union, Mexico, China, Malaysia and Egypt have also pledged support for OPEC's bid to keep prices stable. Norway decided on the initial round of cuts following an OPEC agreement last December which boosted oil prices to around 18 dlrs per barrel from around 14 to 15 dlrs last December. Norway relies on oil for about 40 pct of its total export earnings and was hit hard by the collapse in the oil price during the first half of 1986. But firmer oil prices since then have brought some stability to the economy and helped narrow the foreign trade deficit.

These include oil cakes, cereals, raw cotton, raw and semi-processed leather, gems, castor and sandalwood oil, psyllium husks and seeds, opium and various mineral ores.

Zinn and his firm, which disclosed they hold a 5.1 pct stake in Crazy Eddie common stock, said they may acquire more shares through a negotiated merger or tender offer. Entertainment Marketing was informed on June 25 by Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., acting on behalf of Crazy Eddie, that it would be provided with \"certain information\" about Crazy Eddie, it told the SEC. Entertainment Marketing, a Houston-based firm involved in electronics wholesaling and televised home shopping sales, proposed an eight dlr a share merger acquisition of Crazy Eddie on May 29, and modified the proposal on June 9 to include the possible participation of Crazy Eddie management. Entertainment Marketing told the SEC it expects to meet with Crazy Eddie representatives in the near future.

They said the American decision inevitably carries some risk of armed confrontation, but Iran -- despite its blunt rhetoric -- would want to avoid this as much as Washington. \"As Iran knows very well, what America is bringing into the Gulf could do serious damage,\" said one western diplomat. Diplomats see the greatest potential danger in more attacks on \"soft targets\" such as merchant shipping not protected by American or other western navy vessels patrolling the Gulf. The risk of Iranian attack on U.S. Warships or Kuwaiti oil tankers carrying the U.S. Flag and under naval escort is rated by diplomats as low. However, \"There is the threat that the Iranians, seeing these heavily protected U.S.-flag tankers, will go for softer targets,\" one diplomat said. Tehran Radio quoted Iran's top defence spokesman Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani as saying yesterday that Washington was \"moving to the brink of an armed encounter with us.\" The U.S. is increasing its Gulf fleet from seven to 10 warships and sending the refurbished battleship Missouri to patrol just outside the Strait of Hormuz. The build-up ties in with U.S. plans to start escorting Kuwaiti oil tankers next month, which have been re-registered to fly the American flag to give them naval protection. Shipping serving Kuwait has come under repeated attack by Iran, angered at the emirate's war backing of Iraq. Concern in the region has mounted over the threat posed by Chinese-made Silkworm missiles, which the U.S. says Iran is preparing to deploy near the Strait of Hormuz. The Missouri, with its four-escort flotilla, is likely to make Iran think twice about using the missiles, diplomats said. A military source in the Gulf has said Iran also set up a launching site for the Silkworms on captured Iraqi soil in the Faw peninsula, within range of Kuwait. \"But anything that went as far as a direct attack on Kuwaiti territory would be a very serious escalation\" likely moving world opinion against Iran, remarked one. Some diplomats believe Iran could also consider carrying out reprisals against the United States outside the Gulf. Rafsanjani, who is also parliamentary leader, predicted last Friday \"a river of blood\" throughout the world in the event of any U.S. strike against Iran. Western diplomats said Iran, which Washington has accused of being behind state-sponsored terrorism, had no demonstrable capacity to carry out attacks in the U.S. itself. Diplomats saw few potential targets in Lebanon now that most Americans have left in the wake of kidnappings linked to pro-Iranian groups. But Europe and Asia were potential trouble-spots, and Kuwait was one of the most obvious targets. Any backlash was likely to take the form of sabotage or other action to make it difficult to blame Iran, they added.", "labels": ["crude", "ship"]}, {"id": "test/19689", "text": "FED SETS TWO-DAY SYSTEM REPURCHASES, FED SAYS FED SETS TWO-DAY SYSTEM REPURCHASES, FED SAYS", "labels": ["interest", "money-fx"]}, {"id": "test/19690", "text": "CYCLOPS &lt;CYL> MERGER APPROVED Cyclops Corp said shareholders approved a previously announced merger of the company with a subsidiary of dixons Group PLC.

Illinois fields saw virtually no rain over the weekend but were receiving scattered thundershower activity today, he said. Rain patterns will move across Indiana to Ohio with thudershower activity yielding to more general rains, he said. \"Tomorrow, that eastern area will get 1/4 to one inch, a pretty good rain,\" Mohler said. Rain was heavier than expected over the weekend, sparking an early selloff in soybean futures at the Chicago Board of Trade. Prices were off 14 to 20-1/2 cents with November off 19-1/2 cents at 5.43-1/2 dlrs. Mohler said the cold front now over the eastern belt is expected to move over the central Midwest, then move north later in the week.

In an administrative complaint, the SEC said Allied and its legal adviser failed to promptly inform shareholders and the agency that it had begun talks with Youngstown, Ohio, shopping center developer Edward DeBartolo in response to Campeau's takeover offer. Campeau acquired Allied for an estimated 4.2 billion dlrs on Jan 1, following a battle with DeBartolo. On Sept 25, a day after Allied disclosed that its board had urged rejection of Campeau's Sept 12 tender offer for 58 dlrs a share, Allied began negotiating the sale of six shopping centers to DeBartolo, the SEC said. Allied legal advisor and director George Kern, who heads the merger and acquisitions group at the New York law firm of Sullivan and Cromwell, decided against amending Allied's SEC filing to disclose the talks even though they had resulted in sales price of 405 mln dlrs for the shopping centers, it said. Securities law requires takeover target companies to promptly disclose such things as the sale of major assets. The day after Campeau increased its tender offer to 80 pct of Allied's stock from 55 pct and raised its bid to 66 dlrs a share from 58 dlrs on Sept 29, Allied and a partnership headed by DeBartolo began negotiating a takeover deal aimed at thwarting Campeau, the SEC said. Kern again decided against disclosing the talks in an amended SEC filing, the agency charged. Allied's first disclosure of the DeBartolo takeover was made on Oct 8, even though its board approved the merger on Oct 3 and the merger agreement was executed on Oct 7, the complaint said. DeBartolo and Campeau later engaged in a bitter battle for control of Allied, with Campeau winning out later in October when it bought a block of 25.8 mln shares of Allied stock, or 48 pct of the total, in a controversial move made only minutes after it dropped its hostile tender offer. The acquisition of the additional 48 pct, which a federal judge allowed to be completed, gave Campeau a majority stake in Allied. Campeau bought the rest at 69 dlrs a share. The SEC said it had planned to file a court brief joining with Allied in charging that Campeau had engaged in an illegal tender offer. But the SEC brief was never filed since the case was dropped following an agreement between Campeau and DeBartolo. In the administrative proceeding against Allied and Kern, the SEC is asking for an administrative order that they comply with reporting provisions of securities laws in the future.

Ten of the departing companies were based in San Francisco. During the period, only six located in the city achieved Fortune 500 status. Ted Hall, a council director and local managing director of McKinsey and Co. which conducted the survey, said the study grew out of concern that mergers and acquisitions had seriously hurt the economic climate of northern California. However, Hall said that only about 36,000 jobs had been lost in the region, while more than 600,000 new jobs were created during the period. At the same time, he said, the region experienced a greater rise in per capita income and lower unemployment than the rest of the United States and California. Council President George Keller, who also is chairman and chief executive officer of Chevron Corp., told a news conference that the region had difficulties in persuading companies to locate there because of a fragmented local political system. But he said that because of the amenities of living in San Francisco, he was the envy of many chief executives in other metropolitan area. \"It's a great place to run a business,\" he added, \"but it's a hell of a place to do business with government.\" The study concluded that Chevron, which mergered with Gulf Oil in 1984, would benefit in the long run from the restructuring activity. Among the corporate headquarters lost during the period were Crown Zellerbach, Memorex, Southern Pacific, Castle &amp; Cooke and Rolm. Companies that grew enough during the period to make the Fortune 500 list included Apple Computer, Pacific Telesis, McKesson, Tandem Computer, U.S. Leasing and Amfac. The study by the management consulting firm said that, partly due to corporate restructuring, the rate of job growth in San Francisco has slowed since 1980. In addition, it said that the loss of corporate leadership had adversely affected some of the Bay Area's civic and charitable activities.", "labels": ["acq"]}, {"id": "test/19830", "text": "WTC SHAREHOLDERS APPROVE PITTSTON &lt;PCO> BUYOUT Pittston Co said WTC International N.V. shareholders approved the acquisition of the company by Pittston.

Chevron said a sidetrack well on block 16/26 on the U.K. Continental shelf tested 9,000 barrels per day (bpd) of 20 API crude oil from the tertiary \"Alba\" sand through a three-inch surface choke. \"The estimated amount of oil at the Alba field is around 320 mln barrels,\" Paul Spedding of stockbroker Kleinwort Grieveson and Co told Reuters. He said industry estimates put the total reserves at the field at over one billion barrels, but given the low gravity of oil, the recovery rate would be expected to be around 20-25 pct. Analysts said the results were encouraging, but the potential difficulty of operating and recovering oil in the field was shown by the fact that the first well had to be plugged and a sidetrack drilled. \"The field seems to be shallow and widespread, which will require a multi-platform development in recovery, pushing costs up,\" Christopher Osborne of stockbroker Hoare Govett said. Most analysts said that although the low gravity of the oil found would require additional costs in recovery, the test well showed that it flows well. \"Although the gravity of oil at the field seems to be low, it seems to flow quite well and around 300 mln barrels could be recovered,\" Carol Bell of Phillips and Drew told Reuters. However, Chevron officials declined to comment on the analysts' reserve estimates. They said that without further research and drilling in the area this summer, they would not disclose any reserve figures. Analysts said that if the field were declared commercial and developed, there would be a ready local market for the heavy crude it produced. \"Most refineries are now upgraded to refine heavy oils and the price differentials between heavy and light crudes are a lot narrower today,\" Osborne said.

Speaking before an American-Israel Chamber of Commerce seminar, Yaacobi said that in 1986 Israeli exports to the U.S. were over 2.3 billion dlrs or about one-third of Israel's total exports, while imports from the U.S. were around 1.8 billion dlrs or roughly one-sixth of the total. \"I am convinced that Israel exports to the U.S. can reach five billion dlrs in the next five years, if we learn to function in the American marketplace and place greater emphasis on product quality,\" Yaacobi said. While the weakening of the dollar vis-a-vis European currencies is a \"bottleneck to increasing exports to the U.S.,\" Yaacobi said he expects Israel to extend its recent trend toward higher U.S. exports. In the last ten years, Israeli exports to the U.S. rose fivefold, from 417 mln dlrs to 2.3 billion in 1986, while imports rose from 888 mln dlrs to 1.8 billion last year. Yaacobi said export growth must increase ten to eleven pct annually, the rate achieved until the 1973 Yom Kippur War. He said that the U.S./Israel Free Trade agreement, passed last year and eliminating all duties and other commercial restrictions between the two nations through 1994, would continue to facilitate the desired export growth. Dual agreements included in the FTA allow Israel to act as an economic bridge between the U.S. and Europe, enabling U.S. firms to export to Europe at lower cost if a certain percentage of the exported is produced in Israel, and vice-versa. Yaacobi said that tensions among the nations of the middle east was one of the main reasons Israel had not yet been able to achieve its economic potential. Since 1973 the U.S. has given Israel 25 billion dlrs in aid, but most of it went to defense expenditures and financing military conflicts \"which were imposed on Israel,\" he said. Short of achieving Israel's full growth potential, however, Yaccobi said it would still be possible to achieve economic independence by 1993 or 1994, based on the assumption that exports can be doubled from 1986 levels in that time period.", "labels": ["trade"]}, {"id": "test/19921", "text": "GENCORP INC SAYS TO SELL GENERAL TIRE TO CONTINENTAL GUMMI FOR 650 MLN DLRS GENCORP INC SAYS TO SELL GENERAL TIRE TO CONTINENTAL GUMMI FOR 650 MLN DLRS", "labels": ["acq"]}, {"id": "test/19927", "text": "VENEZUELA BUDGET SEES 16.35 DLRS OIL PRICE Venezuela's government tomorrow presents a 1988 budget proposal for 183.432 billion bolivars, based upon an oil price of 16.35 dlrs per barrel, finance minister Manuel Azpurua said.

Under the agreement the companies said Continental will acquire General Tire, including its related domestic and foreign operations, and Gencorp will retain liability for the medical benefits of retired General Tire employees who retired on or before November 30, 1984. The sale is expected to be completed on or before November one and is subject to meeting certain conditions. Continental is Europe's second largest tire producer. Last year, the company had sales of 2.6 billion dlrs, with 1.9 billion dlrs generated by its tire operations. Last year, General Tire had operating profits of 79 mln dlrs on sales of 1.1 billion dlrs, and Gencorp had operating profits of 130 mln dlrs on sales of 3.1 billion dlrs. GenCorp spokesman Rip Tilden said the company will retain about 100 mln dlrs in liability for its former General Tire employees under the agreement. Tilden said Gencorp will use the proceeds from the sale to reduce its 1.5 billion dlr debt. In April, GenCorp sucessfully thwarted a takeover by a partnership formed by AFG Industries Inc &lt;AFG> and Wagner and Brown with a restructuring program that included the purchase of up to 54 pct, or 12.5 mln shares, of its common at 130 dlrs a share for a total of 1.6 billion dlrs As part of the restructuring, GenCorp also said it planned to sell its tire business, the bottling operations of its RKO General Inc subsidiary, and RKO's remaining broadcast properties to focus on the company's aerospace and automotive components businesses. Tilden said Gencorp expects to realize about 850 mln dlrs in after tax proceeds by the end of 1987 as a result of sale of several pieces of the nonbroadcast assets of the company, including general tire. \"The price paid for General tire would not cause us to reevaluate that estimate,\" said Tilden. General Tire employs 10,000 people worldwide and has four tire manufacturing plants in the U.S. and one in Canada. In a statemnet, A. William Reynolds, GenCorp chairman said the sale of General Tire \"represents a critical accomplishment in our plan to restructure GenCorp.\" Reynolds also said GenCorp's previously announced sale of its other businesses are \"proceeding satisfactorily.\" Among the pieces of Gencorp's empire that remain to be sold are its RKO bottling operations. GenCorp agreed to sell RKO's KHJ-TV station to Walt Disney Co &lt;DIS> for 217 mln dlrs. That deal awaits approval by the Federal Communications Commission.

Commerce and Planning Minister Mahbubul Haq said in a televised speech the government had also decided to allow duty-free import of cotton yarn to make the textile industry more competitive, and to link bulk tea imports to the export of Pakistani products. Cotton and rice are Pakistan's main exports, which have been handled exclusively by state corporations since early 1970s. But Haq said now the private sector would also export cotton and rice along with the corporations, which meets a long-standing demand of the local traders. The duty-free import of cotton yarn has been allowed to bring down prices and help the local ancillary industries compete effectively in the world market, he said. Haq said the new policy, effective from the fiscal year 1987/88 beginning on July 1, would be for three years but reviewed every year. It was a departure from the previous practice of announcing trade policies for a single fiscal year, and Haq said it would enable the businessmen to plan their market strategies over a longer period. He said an export credit of 250 mln dlrs had been provided for the export of engineering goods to selected third world countries on soft credit terms. Pakistan's 1986/87 exports at 3.6 billion dlrs, 18.2 per cent more than in the previous year, and imports at 5.23 billion dlrs compared to 5.63 billion dlrs in 1985/86. He said the government policy was to rationalise and streamline import controls. \"It has been observed that due to restrictions on imports, specially on raw materials and intermediate goods, local industry has been suffering for want of necessary inputs,\" he said. \"Prices have been on the increase and quality of goods produced has been low. This restrictive policy also gave rise to smuggling and hampering of exports.\" He said that to correct this situation, 136 items had freed from import restrictions. Previously, Pakistan has met its trade gap largely from remittances from its nationals working abroad, mainly in the Gulf.

They were responding to comments by London traders that large tonnages of unwanted cocoa beans from Malaysia, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea (PNG) were helping to depress cocoa prices. London traders said the Asian cocoa was considered unsuitable for western palates because of an acrid odour and a high level of free fatty acids. Ng Siew Kee, the chairman of Malaysia's Cocoa Growers' Council, said Malaysia should expand its sales to Asia and the United States if it did not produce a type suitable for Western Europe. A spokesman for the PNG Cocoa Industry Board said the London market was mistaken if it linked PNG cocoa with high-acid Malaysian and Indonesian beans. \"When the market is declining, buyers seize on anything to talk down prices,\" the spokesman said. He said that PNG could sell whatever cocoa it produces.

Officials have said Malaysian production is expected to total 150,000 to 155,000 tonnes in calendar 1987. This is up from 131,000 tonnes in 1986, partly because of the end of a three-year drought in Sabah, the country's largest cocoa growing area.

Output is projected to rise to 50,000 tonnes in 1988 from 38,000 tonnes this year as young trees mature. Both Malaysia and Indonesia are low cost producers and traders said they could last out low prices longer than West African countries. According to one Kuala Lumpur trader, world prices would have to fall another 1,000 ringgit per tonne (about 250 stg) to make cocoa production in Malaysia uneconomic.

Shortly after Poehl spoke, the Bundesbank announced a tender for a securities repurchase pact at a fixed rate of 3.80 pct. Previous tenders over the last month by interest rate have seen the allocation rate on these facilities rise to 3.85 pct at last week's pact from 3.60 on the last fixed-rate tender in late September. The Bundesbank's reduction of the key allocation rate to 3.80 from 3.85 pct was heralded Monday by repeated injections of money market liquidity at between 3.70 and 3.80 pct. These moves to cap interest rates followed a meeting between Poehl, Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker Monday in Frankfurt. Officials said afterwards the three men had reaffirmed their commitment to the Louvre accord on currency stability. Over the weekend, criticism by Baker of the tightening in West German monetary policy had prompted a sharp fall of the dollar on speculation that Louvre cooperation had ended. But the dollar rallied on news of Monday's meeting in nervous trading to trade above 1.79 marks Tuesday. Poehl said that the recent rise in interest rates was not due to central bank policy, but to markets' expectations, and currency developments. Commenting on the inflationary expectations, Poehl said \"You have to get to the root of the problem, you have to pursue a policy which reveals that there are no grounds for such fears.\" The inflationary fears were unjustified and exaggerated, he said. Poehl rebuffed recent U.S. Criticism of West Germany, saying the Bundesbank had made a substantial contribution to international cooperation in interest and monetary policy. The Bundesbank has tolerated an overshooting of its money supply target, arousing criticism from other quarters, he said. \"Today we still have lower interest rates than at the end of 1986... Quite the contrary of other countries, where interest rates have risen substantially more,\" Poehl said. This had to be taken into account when considering recent rises in repurchase pact allocation rates, which were due to rising international money market rates that had spilled over into the German market, he said. Poehl expressed surprise that financial markets had so far ignored improvements in the U.S. Deficits. \"The adjustment process in the U.S. Trade balance is definitely underway,\" he said, noting that this was not so noticeable in absolute figures.

The bill, which was defeated by the Senate Agriculture Committee on Monday, could have cost about 60 mln dlrs a year in lost exports, the Philippine Coconut Authority (PCA) said. \"Naturally, we welcomed the defeat but there is a chance the bill will be resurrected and attached as a rider to another Senate bill,\" a spokesman for the United Coconut Association of the Philippines (UCAP). PCA chairman Jose Romero noted the vote was close, with eight senators voting for it, 10 against and one abstaining. The UCAP spokesman said the American Soybean Association (ASA) had spent about 25 mln dlrs lobbying for the bill. He said the ASA also had obscured the health issue during the debate. \"Coconut oil is high in saturated fats, but unlike saturated animal fats, they do not enter the blood and lymph systems leaving fatty deposits connected to heart disease,\" he said. U.S. Soybean and cottonseed producers had argued that saturated fats cause heart disease and that the labels would discourage consumption by health conscious consumers in favour of domestic unsaturated alternatives. Opponents of the bill said the proposal discriminated against imports and would damage the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia. The Philippines earned 488 mln dlrs from coconut products in 1986, up from 477 mln in 1985, UCAP figures show.

A rise in interest rates now would only serve to spark further selling of shares that could ultimately have a major deflationary impact on the real economy, they said. Although Bank of Japan officials have consistently maintained that they had no plans to raise the 2.5 pct discount rate, many in the markets have thought otherwise. Fears of a rise in the discount rate were fanned by the central bank's apparent decision last week to countenance higher rates on commercial bills, dealers said. But today's stock market collapse -- prices fell nearly 15 pct -- means that the Bank of Japan would be hard pressed to raise the discount rate now, despite its concerns about a renewed outbreak of inflation, dealers and economists said. Japanese government bond prices rose sharply today as the markets concluded that the stock market's collapse precluded the central bank from carrying out the widely-rumoured discount rate increase. A senior government economist suggested that both the U.S. And Japan needed to ease monetary policy now to prevent a further drop in New York and Tokyo stock prices. \"They need to support the stock and security markets,\" he said. But Bank of Japan officials said they saw no need to change policy for the moment, although one admitted that the central bank may have to rethink its strategy if Tokyo stock prices continue to plunge during the rest of the week. Both government and Bank of Japan economists agreed the economy is better placed now to cope with the deflationary impact of plunging stock prices than it was a few months ago. With the economy recovering strongly, the steep drop in stock prices is not likely to put a major dent in consumer and business confidence, one government economist said. \"There will be some impact on the real economy, but it won't be that big,\" said another. Individuals are not heavily invested in stocks on their own, although they do participate through trust funds and other investment vehicles. And while many manufacturing firms turned to financial market investments for profits during last year's economic downturn, the recent rebound has allowed them to refocus their attention on their core businesses, he said. Paradoxically, it is the pick-up in the economy that is partly to blame for the stock market collapse as companies have shifted funds away from financial investments to increase inventories and step up capital spending, one government economist said. In deciding what response to make to the steep stock price drop, the Bank of Japan must first determine whether prices will continue to fall further and then decide if they pose a greater economic danger than the threat of higher inflation, one central bank official said. \"That will at least take a couple of days, if not weeks,\" he said.", "labels": ["interest"]}, {"id": "test/20052", "text": "RICE RESEARCH INSTITUTE NAMES NEW HEAD The Manila-based International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) said West German agricultural scientist Klaus Lampe will take over as its director-general in early 1988, succeeding M.S.

On Monday, a National Coffee Association newsletter said the Office of U.S. Trade Representative will implement a voluntary compliance system temporarily because legislation to monitor imports is tied up in the Congressional trade bill. Under the arrangement, milar to one in 1980, coffee importers would voluntarily present needed documents to the U.S. government until Congress approves the monitoring authority, but if coffee arrives without valid certification, it will still be allowed entry. While many believe producers will not seek to add to the overburdened stock situation in the U.S., others believe some will ship outside of the quota requirements in lieu of monitoring controls, trade sources said. \"Last time, there was a lot of false information submitted to customs which resulted in a lot of indictments and fines,\" a U.S. Customs spokesman said. \"Customs can do a good job when given the tools, but when its hands are tied, it doesn't have the authority to demand Form O (documents tracking merchandise from source to destination),\" he said. Many see it as a true test of whether producers and importers will abide by the quota system. \"It is a key to seeing whether there are any teeth in the quota agreement,\" said one major U.S. roaster. \"Last time we had a gentleman's agreement, the trade did not act as a gentleman,\" said another analyst adding, \"without the need to submit documents, the ball will be in the producers' hands.\" Some feel that importers will take advantage of the voluntary compliance due to development of a two-tier market, in which non-member countries buy coffee at a big discount. Many fear that dealers will buy coffee destined for non-member countries at discounts and then bring it into the U.S. falsely labelled. According to customs officials, several green coffee importers confessed in 1985 that they had imported coffee fraudulently after buying it for non-member destinations, forging landing certificates and then relabelling it as navy beans. \"If there's that much of a discrepancy between prices for one country and another, producers may be teted to get rid of their stocks of coffee by selling to non-member nations and by circumventing the quota provisions,\" said Paine Webber analyst Bernie Savaiko. Still, others believe that producers will not be hard pressed to aggravate the overburdened coffee stock situation in the U.S. in the near term. \"It would be naive to suggest that any agreement would not have some share of connivance, but I think the voluntary system seemed to suffice and, coupled with the fact that we have so much coffee, I don't think that it poses that much of a threat,\" one trader said.", "labels": ["coffee"]}, {"id": "test/20187", "text": "SMITHKLINE BECKMAN CORP &lt;SKB> 3RD QTR NET Shr 1.18 dlrs vs 87 cts Net 149.6 mln vs 134 mln Revs 1.1 billion vs 956 mln Avg shrs 127.3 mln vs 154.5 mln Nine mths Shr 3.36 dlrs vs 2.42 dlrs Net 428.1 mln vs 373.7 mln Revs 3.1 billion vs 2.7 billion NOTE: 1987 3rd qtr and nine mths net includes a charge of 11 mln dlrs or nine cts a share and 31.8 mln dlrs or 25 cts a share for the interest expense for share repurchases. 1986 nine mths net includes a charge of 28.9 mln dlrs or 19 cts a share for early retirement program and withdrawal of Contac cold remedy from the market due to tampering.", "labels": ["earn"]}, {"id": "test/20189", "text": "UNION CAMP CORP &lt;UCC> 3RD QTR Sept 30 Shr 77 cts vs 50 cts Net 56.5 mln vs 36.4 mln Sales 583.3 mln vs 515.9 mln Nine months Shr 2.02 dlrs vs 1.19 dlrs Net 148.5 mln vs 87.1 mln Sales 1.69 billion vs 1.51 billion", "labels": ["earn"]}, {"id": "test/20191", "text": "NEWELL CO &lt;NWL> 3RD QTR NET Shr 75 cts vs 64 cts Net 11,174,000 vs 7,408,000 Sales 218.8 mln vs 106.3 mln NIne Mths Shr 1.80 dlrs vs 1.54 dlrs Net 23,762,000 vs 16,603,000 Sales 414.8 mln vs 295.9 mln NOTE: 1987 net income excludes preferred dividends of 2.4 mln dlrs in the quarter and 2.7 mln dlrs in the nine months compared with 188,000 dlrs and 563,000 dlrs in 1986.", "labels": ["earn"]}, {"id": "test/20193", "text": "CIRCLE EXPRESS TERMINATES PLANNED ACQUISITION OF OVERLAND EXPRESS CIRCLE EXPRESS TERMINATES PLANNED ACQUISITION OF OVERLAND EXPRESS", "labels": ["acq"]}, {"id": "test/20195", "text": "FIRST VALLEY CORP &lt;FIVC.O> 3RD QTR NET Shr 69 cts vs 62 cts Net 4,401,000 vs 3,808,000 Nine mths Shr 1.99 dlrs vs 1.77 dlrs Net 12.6 mln vs 10.8 mln", "labels": ["earn"]}, {"id": "test/20206", "text": "AVON PRODUCTS INC 3RD QTR NET Shr 37 cts vs 42 cts Net 26.6 mln vs 30.0 mln Sales 805.4 mln vs 690.6 mln Avg shrs 70.6 mln vs 71.0 mln Nine mths Shr 1.23 dlrs vs 1.23 dlrs Net 86.8 mln vs 88.5 mln Sales 2.30 billion vs 2.01 billion Avg shrs 70.3 mln vs 72.2 mln", "labels": ["earn"]}, {"id": "test/20207", "text": "SPRINGS INDUSTRIES INC &lt;SMI> 3RD QTR OCT THREE Shr 99 cts vs 42 cts Net 17.6 mln vs 7,528,000 Sales 424.2 mln vs 376.8 mln Nine mths Shr 2.21 dlrs vs 94 cts Net 39.3 mln vs 16.8 mln Sales 1.20 billion vs 1.10 billion NOTE: Share adjusted for two-for-one stock split in April 1987.", "labels": ["earn"]}, {"id": "test/20208", "text": "OILMEAL DEMAND STILL STRONG IN U.S., SOVIET UNION Oilmeal demand remained strong in the United States in July and August and six pct up on levels seen in the same months last year, with most of the rise coming in soymeal, the Hamburg based publication Oil World said.

In an exclusive interview with Reuters, Lyng said he did not know if the United States will offer Moscow another wheat subsidy offer this year or when that offer will be made. \"Last year it was well into the year before we offered it. There's been nothing that's taken place to indicate to me that there's a pressing need on their part for that sort of deal (a wheat subsidy).\" When asked if a subsidy would be offered at a U.S./Soviet summit, Lyng said, \"No, I don't think so. I don't think that.\" The Agriculture Secretary said a U.S. wheat subsidy deal to Moscow would not be the kind of topic appropriate for discussion at a summit. \"It would not be the kind of issue that the President or the Chairman would get into specific negotiations or discussions about,\" Lyng said. \"When Mr. Nikonov (communist party secretary for agriculture) was here ... he indicated that trade in wheat was not something that would be discussed with the President of the United States. He said it's not presidential,\" Lyng said. Lyng said uncertainties about wheat quality in some major producing areas of the world, volatile wheat prices and the still unfinished Soviet grain harvest could delay any final decision on the timing of another wheat subsidy to Moscow. The future of the U.S./Soviet long-term grains agreement will be discussed the first of next year, Lyng said, but the Agriculture Secretary questioned the benefits of the long-standing agreement. \"We've had three years in a row in which the Soviets have failed to live up to their end of the agreement ...

This throws up the economic abyss of recession in the U.S. With obvious knock on effects on the rest of the world.\" But some economists added that Wall Street's crash, which dragged other major markets down with it, may help curb the very problems that sparked the turmoil - namely world inflation fears and the massive and persistent U.S. Trade deficits. \"If there is a benefit from a 23 pct fall in Wall Street ...It's some sort of resistance to inflation worldwide,\" said Geoffrey Dennis of brokers James Capel, echoing comments from other London and Tokyo analysts. Lower personal wealth from lower stock prices and fears of further falls should dampen credit growth, curbing inflationary pressures and import demand in the U.S., They say. Such considerations may be helping bond markets resist the equity crash, according to Mike Osborne of Kleinwort Grieveson. \"It would be suicidal for any government in the context of what happened in the last couple of days to jack up their interest rates,\" he added. Stocks surged after news Chemical Bank cut its prime lending rate half a point to 9.25 pct Tuesday and U.S. Fed chairman Alan Greenspan pledged support for the financial system. The news eroded the most immediate fears that the stock collapse would spill over into the economy, via a banking crisis for example, thus precipitating recession. It also helped the dollar rally sharply, to a high of 1.8200 marks from a European low of 1.7880. But economists said today's whiplash moves do not have long term significance and that markets should try to keep the underlying fundamentals in mind. \"The United States has been able to live on borrowed time. If the effect of this (crash) is to produce slower economic growth not recession...It contains good news (and) provides a more realistic assessment of the U.S. Economy,\" said Capel's Dennis. But he added that markets are still very much in danger. \"The liquidity doesn't disappear...All it's doing is disappearing from the equity markets,\" Dennis noted. David Morrison of Goldman Sachs International said world market turbulence will be exacerbated if the Group of Seven (G-7) leading western nations confirms a base for the dollar, as implied by West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg's remarks that intervention to support currencies is still on. Last week's dollar fall was partly triggered by expectations that the Germans were more worried about the money supply impact of such intervention than maintaining currency stability. But rigid adherence to dollar ranges would be bad, said Morrison. \"The Louvre Accord is fundamentally misconceived.

An acute crisis of confidence in equity markets over the past two days will in any case subdue personal consumer credit demand which has largely been behind growth in lending. \"In the normal course of events the markets would have been extremely worried about that figure,\" noted Peter Spencer, U.K. Economist with Credit Suisse First Boston. After an initial dip in reaction to the bank lending data, which compared won stg August rise, U.K. Government bonds (gilts) soared as investors continued to flee from plummetting equities into the relative security of government securities. Equity markets dropped sharply on the news, touching a day's low of 1,766.7 on the FTSE 100 index after the data, before staging a recovery. Sterling held its buoyant tone throughout. U.K. Money market rates, in a similarly calm response, resumed the slightly easier trend of earlier in the morning after little more than a token blip as the figures came out. Noting that such a huge rise in credit extended by banks would under other circumstances have prompted market fears of a rise in clearing bank base rates from the current 10 pct, \"With the financial markets doing what they're doing, that's the last thing the Bank of England would want to do,\" Spencer said. \"The monetary situation is clearly very bad but as long as sterling is firm, the authorities are unlikely to put rates up,\" said Kevin Boakes, chief U.K. Economist at Greenwell Montagu Gilt Edged. Boakes pointed to a rise in the narrow money measure M0 to 5.2 pct year-on-year from August's 4.5 pct growth, which he said must cause some concern at the Treasury. But \"The fact that overall broad money growth has slowed down is a rather encouraging sign,\" noted Paul Temperton, U.K. Economist with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. He pointed to a fall in the year-on-year growth rate of the M3 broad money aggregate to 19.5 pct in September from August's 22 pct. It was concern about credit growth which prompted the Bank of England to engineer a one point rise in U.K. Bank base rates to 10 pct in early August, caution endorsed subsequently by news of a massive 4.9 billion stg July rise in bank lending. Temperton noted that a particular focus of bank worry in that period had been the behaviour of U.K. Asset markets. Housing and equities were the key two asset markets in influencing consumer behaviour, he said. In the light of the precipitous falls on U.K. Equity markets in the past few days, \"There will almost certainly be a straightforward impact on consumer spending and on retail sales,\" Temperton said. \"Almost certainly we can look forward to slower growth in consumer borrowing if the equity shakeout continues,\" he added. \"I think the stock market has decided that the bank lending figure is a thing of the past...We are talking about a very serious panic and a flight to quality,\" Spencer said. A U.K. Treasury official said that it was important to look at all the monetary information, not just the bank lending, adding that monetary aggregates were growing much more slowly than bank lending. Senior banking sources noted that the surge in bank lending was evidence of the continuing recent trend of fairly heavy personal sector borrowing. Figures from the Banking Information Service showed personal sector lending by U.K. Clearing banks rose by 1.66 billion stg in September after a 978 mln stg August rise.

Operators said the sharp rise reflected higher output at several of Norway's biggest fields and resumed production at fields shut down for 27 days in August for the Ekofisk field rescue project. Industry analysts said the increase did not exceed Norway's voluntary move to curb by 7.5 pct planned growth in its oil output, a move designed to back OPEC-led efforts to stabilise oil prices by limiting supplies to world crude markets. Norway, not an OPEC member, decided in June to extend the production restraints, enforced since February 1 1987, on all its North Sea fields for the rest of the year. Oil Minister Arne Oeien said last month he expected Norway would extend into 1988 its policy of slowed production growth. The biggest increase was seen on the Ekofisk field, which pumped 168,023 bpd in September against 48,195 bpd in August, field operator Phillips Petroleum Norway Inc said. Ekofisk and the nearby Valhall and Ula fields, which use the Ekofisk pipeline, were shut down for most of August while Phillips raised Ekofisk platforms to counter seabed subsidence. BP Petroleum Development Norway Ltd, operator of the Ula field, said September output rose to 86,727 bpd after dropping to 27,237 bpd in August because of the shutdown. Valhall, operated by Amoco Norway A/S, flowed 74,694 bpd last month compared with 69,748 bpd in August, the company said. September production was also sharply higher at the Statfjord field. Norway's 84 pct share of Statfjord, which extends into the British North Sea sector, was 611,138 bpd against 552,646 bpd in August, operator Den Norske Stats Oljeselskap A/S (Statoil) said. Norway's 22.2 pct share of the Murchison field which, like Statfjord, extends into the British sector, yielded 15,388 bpd in September, a slight 920 bpd decrease from the previous month, Norwegian partners on the British-operated field said. Statoil boosted output at its Gullfaks field to 109,670 bpd in September, compared with 100,188 in August. Norsk Hydro, operator of the Oseberg field, said test output at the field from the mobile production ship Petro Jarl totalled 1,719 bpd last month, down sharply from 16,170 bpd in August. Hydro said the drop was caused by failure to bring on stream a second well, cutting September production to just two days.", "labels": ["crude"]}, {"id": "test/20273", "text": "BRISTOL-MYERS CO &lt;BMY> 3RD QTR NET Shr 70 cts vs 61 cts Net 200.2 mln vs 173.9 mln Sales 1.38 billion vs 1.26 billion Nine mths Shr 1.87 dlrs vs 1.54 dlrs Net 535.6 mln vs 437.8 mln Sales 4.04 billion vs 3.63 billion NOTE: Share adjusted for two-for-one stock split.", "labels": ["earn"]}, {"id": "test/20274", "text": "XYVISION INC &lt;XYVI.O> 2ND QTR SEPTEMBER 26 Shr 14 cts vs 15 cts Net 867,000 vs 956,000 Revs 9,203,000 vs 5,304,000 Six mths Shr 18 cts vs 34 cts Net 1,111,000 vs 1,747,000 Revs 16.7 mln vs 10.4 mln NOTE: 1987 2nd qtr and six mths net includes 279,000 dlrs and 432,000 dlrs for tax credits. 1986 2nd qtr and six mths net includes 361,000 dlrs and 1,747,000 dlrs for tax credits.", "labels": ["earn"]}, {"id": "test/20275", "text": "FIRST REPUBLIC BANK DALLAS CUTS PRIME RATE TO 9.25 PCT FROM 9.75 PCT, EFFECTIVE TODAY FIRST REPUBLIC BANK DALLAS CUTS PRIME RATE TO 9.25 PCT FROM 9.75 PCT, EFFECTIVE TODAY", "labels": ["interest"]}, {"id": "test/20278", "text": "PERKINS FAMILY RESTAURANTS LP &lt;PFR> 3RD QTR Shr 30 cts vs 12 cts Net 3,059,000 vs 1,258,000 Revs 36.2 mln vs 29.1 mln Nine mths Shr 67 cts vs 24 cts Net 6,855,000 vs 2,442,000 Revs 100.9 mln vs 77.8 mln", "labels": ["earn"]}, {"id": "test/20279", "text": "FIRST AMERICAN BANK FOR SAVINGS &lt;FAMB.O> 3RD QTR Shr 35 cts vs 30 cts Net 3,997,000 vs 3,442,000 Nine mths Shr 1.04 dlrs vs not given Net 12.0 mln vs 8,161,000 NOTE: Company went public in July 1986.

It will help us in getting the negotiations underway,\" Lyng told Reuters in an interview Tuesday. Lyng's comment came after EC ministers in Luxembourg endorsed a farm reform package drafted by the EC Commission. The EC plan will be presented at the next meeting of Uruguay round agriculture negotiators in Geneva on October 26. Lyng said the United States would oppose parts of the plan seeking a market sharing agreement for grains, and proposing curbs on U.S. soybean and cereal substitute exports to Europe. The U.S. in July proposed to GATT the elimination of all farm subsidies affecting trade within ten years, and has pressed the EC to make a counter-offer with the aim of reaching a global farm subsidy agreement by the end of 1988. However, the EC and some U.S. domestic groups have said the Reagan administration plan to end all farm trade subsidies is unrealistic. Asked about such criticism, Lyng said \"The alternative to doing that is to say that we preserve them and maintain them. I think that is the unrealistic position.\" \"I would suggest that they (EC) listen to what we are trying to say.\" Lyng also rejected suggestions the U.S. and EC agree a freeze in export subsidies to get the GATT negotiations started. \"All that some countries would like to have would be a wheat agreement where we would stop export subsidies on wheat. That doesn't do a thing for us,\" Lyng said. The United States wants an end to subsidies in a range of agricultural products from dairy products to vegetable oils, he said. At the GATT negotiators meeting next week Canada is expected to offer a proposal as well as the EC.

Shippers can choose their best period of 12 consecutive months between April 1, 1985, and September 30, 1987, to be used for calculating the export performace portion. The IBC will total all the figures, calculate each shippers participation and use this as a basis for allocation of individual quotas, the IBC spokesman said.

Shippers can bid a premium over the contribution quota payable on coffee exports and the succesful bidder will add this premium to the contribution quota when he submits his export sales declaration form. Auctions will not start until after the opening of export registrations. The spokesman could not say when this might be but trade sources said an announcement could come at the end of the week, opening registraions from Monday.

He was speaking after a meeting of farm leaders with the Danish foreign and agriculture ministers, who currently chair meetings of their EC colleagues.

This would in turn help the market position for certain crops of which the EC is a net importer such as oilseeds, peas and beans, but for which the Commission is now proposing severe output restrictions. A minority of EC ministers opposed to an oils and fats tax on imported and domestically produced oils and marine fats succeeded in blocking the idea during this year's annual EC price fixing.

Lyng said he is optimistic the ruling will favor the U.S. \"These are quota items, and the principles that apply to them, it seems to me, will have some bearing on the question of whether you would have quotas or not on beef and citrus,\" Lyng told Reuters in an interview.

The Japanese quotas on 12 food categories which the United States has challenged include items such as tomato paste, some cheeses and specialty fruit juices. U.S. officials had hoped a ruling against the quotas would be issued earlier this year but the GATT panel decision has been delayed by the illness of the tribunal's chairman. The U.S. has taken a hardline stance on the beef and citrus quotas, which Tokyo says must remain in place to protect Japanese farmers. \"We will not negotiate new quotas or accept new quotas (on beef and citrus).

ASA Vice President James Adams told an ASA-sponsored Outlook 87 conference: \"It will be filed unless the EC takes drastic and immediate steps.\" \"These subsidies are blatantly unfair and are GATT illegal, since they were established after the zero soybean duty was established in 1962,\" he said. The ASA's unfair trade petition against the EC would ask for an investigation and modification of EC oilseed policies to make the regime non-discriminatory. The EC in 1962 ruled all EC oilseed imports duty-free, in an effort to fill its oilseed needs. But EC oilseeds production has risen dramatically since then. The EC now guarantees oilseed prices to farmers above world market levels and is considering implementing a controversial oils and fats tax. The subsidies \"are obvious attempts to circumvent the zero duty binding and that makes U.S. Farmers mad as hell,\" Adams said. The ASA is confident the U.S. Congress will support its trade complaint, Adams said. The ASA also strongly opposes an EC proposal to tax vegetable and marine oils consumed in the EC, which will be considered by the EC Commission in December. U.S. Soybean world market share has declined 35 pct in volume and 40 pct in value since 1982, primarily as a result of EC policies, Adams added.

Those rights are now being challenged by the European Community's (EC) agricultural support policies, he told a conference sponsored by the American Soybean Association. He reiterated Washington's firm intention to retaliate if the EC goes ahead and bans imports of hormone-fed beef without the issue being investigated by a GATT special committee. The U.S. claims the EC directive, due to come into effect on January 1, threatens to cut 100 mln dlrs worth of U.S. meat shipments into the EC. The U.S. also will oppose all EC efforts to impair U.S. trade via the EC oilseeds regime, which supports EC oilseed prices over the current market level and which may be extended to include a hotly disputed oils and fats tax, Samuels said. Reduction of trade-distorting world agricultural subsidies, an aim of most key participants in GATT multilateral trade negotiations, \"is meaningless if import barriers continue to be erected,\" Samuels said. Samuels called the U.S. plan to eliminate world farm subsidies by the year 2000, proposed at GATT in July, \"visionary\" and \"very serious.\" The EC and Japan have said it is unrealistic. The EC Commission this month announced its draft proposal on farm trade reform, expected to be tabled at GATT formally next week. The EC scheme involves emergency measures to reduce tensions in troubled surplus sectors of cereals and cereals substitutes, dairy and sugar. It also calls for reduction of farm subsidies. The U.S. Is not opposed to short-term measures, as long as they are directly linked to long-term commitments to end major trade distortions, Samuels said. Washington will review the EC proposal when it is formally submitted and respond to it officially then. \"We will consider its relation to the Punta del Este declaration to correct trade problems and expand market access,\" the U.S. Ambassador said. The U.S. can say no to the EC proposal if the EC ignores the U.S. plan when it tables its own proposal, he added. The key difference between the two approaches is that the U.S. wants farm subsidies eliminated, while the EC is pushing only for a reduction in farm suppports, Samuels said. If the EC farm budget were protected by a subsidy freeze, there would be little incentive for the Community to work to correct the international trade situation, he added. Samuels cited the animal hormones complaint, the EC oilseeds regime and an EC regulation concerning meat imports to third countries as three crucial barriers to trade which the U.S. wants to see resolved under the auspices of GATT.", "labels": ["carcass", "livestock", "sugar", "trade"]}, {"id": "test/20463", "text": "US WEST INC &lt;USW> 3RD QTR NET Shr 1.46 dlrs vs 1.41 dlrs Net 277.5 mln vs 268.3 mln Sales 2.13 billion vs 2.14 billion Avg shrs 189.8 mln vs 189.8 mln Nine mths Shr 3.95 dlrs vs 3.78 dlrs Net 750.5 mln vs 718.4 mln Sales 6.28 billion vs 6.22 billion Avg shrs 189.9 mln vs 190.2 mln", "labels": ["earn"]}, {"id": "test/20464", "text": "US WARNS IRAN, BEGINS ESCORTING TANKER CONVOY The United States warned Iran again that it was ready to retaliate for any further hostile military action in the Gulf as U.S. warships began escorting another tanker convoy southward from Kuwait.

But they added Washington set the stakes high by testing the limits of the Louvre accord while global stock markets were plunging. West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker reaffirmed their commitment to currency stability at a secret meeting yesterday in Frankfurt, according to official statements released late Monday. Only 13 hours after the statements were released, the Bundesbank reduced short-term interest rates by offering banks liquidity at a fixed bid rate of 3.80 pct, down from a 3.85 pct facility rate offered last week. While the two ministers were meeting with Bundesbank president Karl Otto Poehl, the central bank had also added money market liquidity repeatedly, signalling it did not want a strong rise in the tender allocation rate on Tuesday. \"It's round one to the Americans, \" said Richard Reid, senior European economist for brokers UBS/Philips and Drew in London. But Reid added, \"We shouldn't forget that it has taken one of the biggest stock market crashes in decades to get the West Germans to cut their security repurchase rate by a 0.05 percentage point.\" Over the weekend, criticism by Baker of earlier tightening of West German monetary policy led to a sharp dollar fall and fuelled speculation that the Louvre accord was no longer valid. Six leading industrial nations agreed under February's Louvre Accord to stabilise currencies and coordinate monetary policies. It has since been reaffirmed by the Group of Seven - the US, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada. The Frankfurt meeting on Monday soothed currency markets and the dollar gained over two pfennigs in after hours trading in New York. At the Frankfurt fixing on Tuesday, the dollar was quoted at 1.7918 marks compared with 1.7740 on Monday. Guenther Aschoff, chief economist at Deutsche Genossenschaftbank in Frankfurt said massive declines on world stock markets had been the main reason for the fall in West German short-term interest rates on Tuesday. \"The Bundesbank wanted to set a marker after stock market losses... That was the responsible thing to do and if it fits with Baker's wishes, then all the better,\" he said. No central bank wants to let interest rates rise, and the Bundesbank had been forced to put its rates up following rises in the U.S., Aschoff said. Poehl told a conference in Frankfurt on Tuesday the central bank has no interest in higher capital market rates and he thought the global rate increase was a cause for concern. Giles Keating, economist with Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd in London said \"The cautious Bundesbank has beaten a retreat and Baker has won a battle...But he hasn't won the war as the security repurchase rate is still 20 points higher than it was before the IMF meeting last month in Washington.\" Before the IMF meeting, when the Louvre Accord was reaffirmed, the Bundesbank was offering money market liquidity at 3.60 pct, Keating noted. Economists said the United States now appeared to have agreed to play by the rules of the Louvre Accord and support the dollar in return for the German action on interest rates. Any further sharp decline of the dollar would hinder Washington's efforts to reduce its trade deficit, Stoltenberg told a news conference on Tuesday. He added he would not rule out central banks of leading industrial countries intervening on exchange markets to defend the dollar's value. Deutsche Genossenschaftbank's Aschoff stressed West Germany's heavy dependence on exports and the need for currency stability. In addition, both the U.S. And West German central banks were keen to avoid a dollar slide which would force them to again spend vast sums intervening to support the dollar.", "labels": ["interest", "money-fx"]}, {"id": "test/20502", "text": "LA PETITE ACADEMY INC &lt;LPAI.O> 3RD QTR NET Shr 13 cts vs nine cts Net 2,062,000 vs 1,418,000 Revs 33.1 mln vs 26.9 mln Nine mths Shr 45 cts vs 33 cts Net 7,053,000 vs 5,156,000 Revs 95.5 mln vs 75.7 mln NOTE: Share adjusted for stock dividends.", "labels": ["earn"]}, {"id": "test/20507", "text": "TELECONCEPTS CORP &lt;TCC> 3RD QTR NET Shr profit 14 cts vs profit one ct Net profit 502,251 vs profit 22,012 Sales 4,715,846 vs 3,731,900 Avg shrs 3,489,342 vs 3,288,720 Nine mths Shr profit 19 cts vs loss 20 cts Net profit 637,305 vs loss 658,398 Sales 12.2 mln vs 9,806,301 Avg shrs 3,439,065 vs 3,288,720 Backlog 1,726,150 vs 739,540", "labels": ["earn"]}, {"id": "test/20511", "text": "EC AGREES TRADE DEAL WITH ARGENTINA The European Community (EC) agreed a trade deal with Argentina designed to compensate the country following the entry of Spain and Portugal into the group, EC officials said. Under the deal agreed by EC foreign ministers, Argentina will gain additional trading rights on a series of products including meat, fish and cereals by-products. But ministers failed to agree on new trade deals with Canada and Japan and are due to study these again, the officials said. The deal with Argentina was agreed by a majority of EC states after West Germany withdrew objections to increased quotas for Argentina on high-quality beef. Ireland and France continued to oppose the deal on meat, saying that the main dispute was over sales of cereals substitutes, but they were outvoted by the other states, the officials said. Under the deal, Argentina will benefit from improved quotas on exports of beef to the EC. In particular the quota on high-quality Hilton beef will be raised by 4,500 tonnes to 34,300 tonnes and quotas on frozen boneless beef will be increased by 3,000 tonnes to 53,000 tonnes. Argentina will also benefit from an additional quota of 5,000 tonnes of frozen hake fillets at 10 pct duty and reduced levies on 550,000 tonnes of wheat bran, the officials said. The improved trade terms were offered after Argentina said that Spain and Portugal's entry into the EC affected their exports of cereals substitutes to these two countries. They have been negotiated under the rules of GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade). But officials said ministers had been unable to resolve Canadian claims that its sales of certain fish to Spain had been affected by the country's EC membership. Officials said the EC had asked GATT to arbitrate on the fish dispute with Canada. Ministers also decided to continue talks with Japan. The EC claims that Spain and Portugal's entry into the group has improved trade conditions for Japan but has been unsatisfied with Japanese offers of compensation. Japan's main offers were to improve inspection systems on citrus fruits to aid EC exports, to improve tariffs for some other farm produce, to increase tariffs for leather footwear and to offer better trade terms for Spain and Portugal. EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq told journalists: \"We maintain our position that the (Japanese) concessions were not enough.\" \"We hope that there will be an improvement,\" he said.", "labels": ["carcass", "grain", "livestock", "trade", "wheat"]}, {"id": "test/20514", "text": "WELLS FARGO AND CO &lt;WFC> RAISES QUARTERLY DIV Qtly div 50 cts vs 39 cts Pay Jan 20 Record Dec 31", "labels": ["earn"]}, {"id": "test/20515", "text": "PETROLANE PARTNERS L.P. &lt;LPG> 3RD QTR LOSS Shr loss five cts vs profit six cts Net loss 1.2 mln vs profit 1.4 mln Revs 114.9 mln vs 109.3 mln Nine months Shr profit one dlrs vs profit 84 cts Net profit 23.7 mln vs profit 19.9 mln Revs 430.9 mln vs 435.4 mln NOTE: Results are in pro forma form.

U.S. naval forces destroyed an offshore oil platform and raided another in what the administration called a \"measured and appropriate response\" to an Iranian Silkworm missile attack last Friday on a U.S.-flagged tanker in Kuwaiti waters. Private analysts generally agreed that going after the rig rather than an onshore economic or military target such as Silkworm launch sites reflected a careful bid by Washington to limit the political, military and diplomatic fallout both at home and in the Gulf. \"It simply demonstrated the United States will take military action when they (Iran) take military action,\" Norman Polmar, a defense analyst and author, said. He said hitting the platforms had spared Iran the embarrassment of casualties on its own soil, possibly avoiding an escalating spiral of attack and counterattack. In addition, it minimized the risk to U.S. forces and the potential embarrassment of any losses, including aircraft that could have been shot down had they taken part in an attack. Anthony Cordesman, author of a new book on the Iran-Iraq war, said the United States apparently chose a limited target to keep alive the possibility that U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar might still persuade Iran to accept a Security Council call for a ceasefire. \"We want the U.N. peace initiative to work if there's any chance at all,\" he said, adding that the action made it clear tougher steps would follow if Iran to attack Gulf shipping. In targeting an oil rig -- albeit one said by the Pentagon to have been turned into a military command post -- Washington also sent a message that it might be willing to attack Iran's economic lifeline. Pentagon officials said the platform had been used as a base for Iranian raids against shipping in the lower Gulf. \"We have chosen a military target, but we also have shown Iran that we are willing to interfere with its oil-exporting capabilities,\" Cordesman said. He predicted the United States would respond to any future major Iranian challenges by hitting Iran's naval base at Bandar Abbas on the Straits of Hormuz, followed by mining the approaches to Iran's oil export terminal on Kharg Island. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said on Monday the United States did not seek further confrontation with Iran, \"but we will be prepared to meet any escalation of military action by Iran with stronger countermeasures.\"", "labels": ["crude"]}, {"id": "test/20634", "text": "ADOBE RESOURCES CORP &lt;ADB> 3RD QTR NET Shr loss two cts vs loss 41 cts Net profit 4,134,000 vs loss 3,682,000 Revs 22.8 mln vs 23.5 mln Nine mths Shr profit 44 cts vs loss 1.99 dlrs Net profit 25.6 mln vs loss 26.8 mln Revs 73.4 mln vs 86.7 mln NOTE: 1987 qtr and nine mths includes gain 1,374,000 dlrs, or five cts per share, and 10.2 mln dlrs, or 41 cts per share, respectively, from net operating loss carryforward. 1987 qtr and nine mths includes loss 4,850,000 dlrs, or 16 cts per share, and loss 14.6 mln dlrs, or 58 cts per share, respectively, from payment of preferred dividends. 1986 qtr and nine mths includes loss 4,850,000 dlrs, or 23 cts per share, and 14.6 mln dlrs, or 70 cts per share, respectively, from payment of preferred dividends.", "labels": ["earn"]}, {"id": "test/20637", "text": "U.S. EXPORTERS REPORT 125,000 TONNES OF CORN SOLD TO USSR FOR 1987/88 U.S. EXPORTERS REPORT 125,000 TONNES OF CORN SOLD TO USSR FOR 1987/88", "labels": ["corn", "grain"]}, {"id": "test/20639", "text": "KENNER PARKER TOYS INC &lt;KPT> 3RD QTR OPER Oper shr 1.22 dlrs vs 88 cts Oper net 13.5 mln vs 11.7 mln Revs 139.1 mln vs 160.5 mln Nine mths Oper shr 2.00 dlrs vs 1.15 dlrs Oper net 22.8 mln vs 15.4 mln Revs 348.8 mln vs 385.9 mln NOTE: 1987 3rd qtr and nine mths oper net excludes gains from tax loss carryforwards of 3,067,000 dlrs and 8,548,000 dlrs respectively. 1986 3rd qtr and nine mths oper net excludes tax carryforward gains of 7,446,000 dlrs and 9,814,000 dlrs, respectively.", "labels": ["earn"]}, {"id": "test/20640", "text": "TENNANT CO &lt;TANT.O> 3RD QTR NET Shr 50 cts vs 47 cts Net 2,646,000 vs 2,611,000 Sale 41.4 mln vs 38.7 mln Nine mths Shr 1.13 dlrs vs 1.04 dlrs Net 6,038,000 vs 5,545,000 Sales 117.2 mln vs 108.4 mln", "labels": ["earn"]}, {"id": "test/20641", "text": "WELBILT &lt;WELB.O> ACQUIRES FOOD HANDLING SYSTEMS Welbilt Corp said it acquired &lt;Food Handling Systems Inc> of Dallas, a producer of commercial ovens, conveyers and proofer systems.

Irving would not comment on how the drop in the market affects its position on the bid or whether it would buy back any of its own shares. Earlier this month, Irving rejected the bid as inadequate and said it wanted to retain its independence. In late September, Bank of New York offered 80 dlrs per share in cash for 47.4 pct of Irving. For the remaining 52.6 pct, it offered an exchange of 1.9 shares of its shares for one Irving share. At that time, the stock purchase portion was worth close to 80 dlrs per share, but now that portion is worth 53 dlrs per share for a net price of 68 dlrs, one analyst said. According to the prospectus offer, shareholders may tender for all cash or all shares on a first come, first serve basis. Analysts were mixed about how the stock price drop would affect the acquisition. \"If it gets to the Irving shareholders, they would approve it, but Irving hopes the offer won't go to the shareholders,\" said Mark Alpert, banking analyst with Bear Stearns Cos Inc. \"And the market is saying the deal won't go through,\" Alpert said. \"The transaction looks highly unlikely to be completed at present. If Irving wouldn't go with the offer at 80 dlrs a share, then they won't go at a lower price,\" another analyst said. The analyst also doubted that Bank of New York could afford to retain its original offer. However, industry sources were more uncertain about prospects for the deal. \"With Irving's price so low, Bank of New York's offer will look good to Irving shareholders,\" said Michael Flores, a consultant at Bank Earnings International, a consulting firm. The drop of Irving's share to 44 dlrs per share, which is about a 26 dlr drop from the beginning of last week, increases the chance that Bank of New York will succeed, Flores said. Analysts said that the drop in bank stock prices is likely to depress the level of mergers and acquisition in the banking industry. \"Bank takeovers are less likely because banks can't use their own stock to make acquisitions because their share price is too depressed,\" Alpert said. Since only banks can buy another bank, the only other possible acquirors would be a foreign bank, Alpert said. \"In the market drop the stock of acquirors got clobbered more than the acquirees,\" another analyst said.", "labels": ["acq"]}, {"id": "test/20746", "text": "KOLLMORGEN CORP &lt;KOL> 3RD QTR NET Shr profit 15 cts vs loss 40 cts Net profit 1,538,000 vs loss 4,088,000 Revs 70.6 mln vs 73.2 mln Nine mths Shr loss eight cts vs loss 57 cts Net loss 832,000 vs loss 5,821,000 Revs 217.0 mln vs 248.4 mln NOTE: 1987 qtr and nine mths includes gain 265,000 dlrs, or three cts per share, from utilization of tax loss carryforward.", "labels": ["earn"]}, {"id": "test/20747", "text": "FARM FRESH INC &lt;FFSH.O> 3RD QTR NET Shr one cts vs 20 cts Net 122,556 vs 2,627,205 Revs 192.2 mln vs 193.3 mln Nine mths Shr 27 cts vs 56 cts Net 3,556,424 vs 7,531,664 Revs 560.6 mln vs 542.3 mln", "labels": ["earn"]}, {"id": "test/20753", "text": "FIRST REPUBLICBANK &lt;FRB.N> CORP 3RD QTR LOSS shr diluted loss 46 cts net loss 6,300,000 nine mths shr diluted loss 10.89 dlrs net loss 309,100,000 NOTE: No comparisons because company was formed in June 1987 through merger of RepublicBank Corp and Interfirst Corp.

Baker's weekend blast at the West German Bundesbank for boosting interest rates seemed to signal an unraveling of an international accord to stabilize currency values. Nigel Lawson, British Chancellor of the Exchequer, was among those who said the treasury secretary's statements helped spur a wave of stock sales by making already jittery investors think that a clash between the two major economic powers would damage the world economy. Lawson told a London television interviewer Tuesday, \"I think the scale of the (stock) fall was very great. That, I think, was partly due to statements that have been made by senior figures on the other side of the Atlantic.\" It was a dispute that should never have happened, he added. Although Baker appeared to patch over the rift at a hastily-called meeting with West German officials Monday, he still faced a storm of criticism on his return to the United States on Tuesday. Baker cut short a long-planned trip to Scandinavia to return here to deal with the economic crisis. Said one U.S. analyst of Baker's weekend remarks, \"His timing could not have been worse.\" One government bond salesman in New York said, \"He actually thought that yelling at the Germans, and threatening to smack the dollar down would work. That doesn't show much understanding of international monetary gamesmanship.\" However, some analysts said West Germany's stubborn march toward higher interest rates may have forced Baker's hand. \"On the surface Baker may look responsible for this, but if you go back to see what caused it (unsettling of financial markets), it was West German policy,\" said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities International in New York. \"All Mr. Baker did was to mention the obvious in public, so making him responsible for it was a little like killing the messenger,\" he said. After Monday's talks, the U.S. and West German governments made it clear that the Louvre currency accord, pieced together in Paris in February, was still in effect. Wall Street feared that collapse of the agreement might be a prelude to hyper-inflation and economic malaise similar to the late 1970s. Analysts believe Monday's Wall Street crash wiped out about 500 billion dlrs in stock values. Treasury sources said that Baker, already unhappy about Bonn's refusal to stimulate its economy in order to keep the global recovery moving, was angered by a Bundesbank interest rate boost that seemed destined to do just the opposite. He felt that the U.S. recovery, inching along in its 59th month, could no longer be the only engine of global economic expansion. A growing U.S. economy has been serving as a huge market for debtor country exports. Moreover, Baker, the consummate politician, was worried that the Republican party might face next year's presidential election with its main showpiece -- a vibrant economy -- badly tarnished. A rise in global interest rates might worsen the debt crisis and completely choke off U.S. economic growth that has already slowed to a tepid 3.2 pct annual rate. \"There's no doubt that it can have an adverse effect on the economy, and it's important that the psychology turn around quickly, or else obviously the panic will feed on itself, and eventually there'll be a serious price to pay economically,\" former deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman said in a television interview. In many ways, the official response was mild. Washington was stunned by the sudden Wall Street retreat, with President Reagan speaking for most people by admitting that he was \"puzzled.\" U.S. government sources said the secretary immediately returned to the Treasury to be briefed on market developments and, presumably, their political impact. For all of this, it seems unlikely that Baker's status in Washington will diminish because of the market fall. Asked by reporters if somebody's head should roll because of the Wall Street retreat, Texas Democratic Senator Lloyd Bentsen said with some irony, \"Oh, I think it's much too late to be doing that...You have an administration that's taken the attitude that we can put the country on automatic pilot and --- retire to the living room to take a nap.

Reagan lifted 51 mln dlrs of the sanctions last June after Japan ended selling the semiconductors on the U.S. market at below production costs.

The Administration officials said Commerce Department monitors showed that Japan was ending its dumping of the semiconductors in third countries, where they had been taking sales away from American-made semiconductors. They said it was likely the 51 mln dlrs in sanctions would be lifted by the end of the month. The United States and Japan remain at odds over opening the closed Japanese markets to U.S. goods.

He said the Canadian and Israeli pacts will not set back worldwide reform efforts under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) as some critics feared but help them. The GATT talks began a year ago in Punta del Este, Uruguay to liberalize the global trading system and to include in it trade in agriculture and services such as banking. Yeutter made his remarks at a U.S.-Israeli trade meeting marking the second year of their bilateral accord. The Canadian-U.S. pact, signed by two sides two weeks ago, has yet been approved by the U.S. Congress and Canadian Parliament. The two free trade agreements (FTA) would gradually remove tariffs and other barriers to cross-border trade in goods and many services. Yeutter said in the aftermath of the Canadian and Israeli pacts \"other countries have realized that if they want to continue to have access to the world's largest market, they had better get serious about improving the GATT.\" The pact with Israel, he said, is gradually increasing shipments both ways and the Canadian pact will substantially increase the gross national products in both countries. Yeutter also said the Canadian and Israeli pacts should serve as important precedents for progress in GATT. Yeutter said, \"increasing trade is one of the keys to enhanced political and economic stability around the globe.\" He said, \"a stronger GATT will enhance prosperity, not only for advanced industrial nations, but also for other countries that need to increase trade in order to better their standards of living.\" Yeutter added it was important not to risk the progress made in the Israeli and Canadian trade pacts by resorting to protectionism. He was referring to trade legislation pending in Congress that would force the United States to take retaliatory actions against nations with large trade surpluses with the United States if the countries practiced unfair trade. The legislation was prompted by a growing U.S. trade deficit that hit 156 billion dlrs last year and is still rising. Yeutter said the pressures for Congress to act were hard to resist, but the pending legislation would undermine President Reagan's efforts to liberalize the world trade. Yeutter renewed the threat of a White House veto. He said, \"President Reagan will veto any bill that contains serious flaws, and I believe that veto would be sustained.\"", "labels": ["trade"]}, {"id": "test/20868", "text": "BAKER/STOLTENBERG MEETING SOOTHES MARKETS News of a meeting between U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker and West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg on Monday soothed currency markets, allowing the dollar to recoup much of the day's losses, dealers said. News of the meeting, which took place in Frankfurt in great secrecy, came after the dollar fell sharply on criticism by Baker of West German monetary policy, which had provoked fears that the Louvre pact on currency stability was in jeopardy. The dollar reacted immediately to the news, rising over two pfennigs in after hours New York trading, dealers there said. The announcement of the meeting, also attended by Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl, was made simultaneously in Bonn and Washington, timed for after the closure of New York markets. Baker, Stoltenberg and Poehl agreed to pursue the policies accepted under the February Louvre accord, a finance ministry spokesman in Bonn said. The dollar rose to 1.7970/90 marks from New York's close of 1.7730/40. It had closed there on Friday at 1.7975/85 marks. The dollar had tumbled nearly three pfennigs as the market reacted to Baker's criticism of rising West German interest rates, and stock markets crashed worldwide. Baker had said that West Germany was apparently breaching the Louvre accord. Under the accord, leading industrial democracies pledged to coordinate economic policies to foster currency stability, with the surplus countries, West Germany and Japan, stimulating their economies and the U.S. promising to cut its budget deficit. West German government sources said rising West German money market rates could not be seen as a breach of the Louvre pact. They were rather a direct reaction to higher interest rates in the United States. U.S. Bond yields have been rising since May on inflationary fears and in early September the Fed raised the discount rate to 6.00 pct from 5.50. German yields have also risen over this period, but less markedly, and since late September the Bundesbank has nudged up short-term rates by changing the terms on its security repurchase pacts, its principal instrument for steering the money market. The allocation rate on the last facility was 3.85 pct, compared with 3.60 pct. This was partly due to West Germany's inability to uncouple itself from U.S. interest rate trends, but also reflected concern among monetary conservatives in the Bundesbank central bank council about excessive monetary growth, which raised fears of domestically produced inflation, bank economists said. This monetary tightening reflected a switch from the pragmatic line pursued by Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl since early this year to stabilise the mark externally, to the more cautious approach of Vice President Helmut Schlesinger. In an apparent gesture to Baker, coinciding with his visit, the Bundesbank repeatedly added money market liquidity this morning. Dealers said this was clearly a move to appease U.S. anger over the most recent West German interest rate rises. \"They (the Bundesbank) just don't want to come too much under American fire,\" said Chris Zwermann, currency adviser at Swiss Bank Corp here. \"It seems to me that this is the Bundesbank beating quite a significant retreat from its position,\" added Giles Keating, economist at Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd in London. The significance that retreat will emerge from the terms of the Bundesbank's next tender for a securities repurchase pact on Tuesday, and its result on Wednesday, money market economists said. Today's injection of liquidity shows that the Bundesbank does not want a further strong rise in the tender allocation rate, which is likely to turn out at between 3.80 and 3.90 pct, little changed from the 3.85 pct on the last facility. The Bundesbank and Finance Ministry had given no indication that the meeting would take place, although the Finance Ministry spokesman said it had been arranged last week. Earlier on Monday the Finance Ministry spokesman, asked to comment on the apparent U.S.-German clash over the Louvre accord, went no further than quoting Stoltenberg as saying he assumed monetary cooperation would continue.

One of them, sitting astride the Rostam offshore oilfield, was all but blown out of the water by U.S. Warships on Monday. The Iranian platform, an unsightly mass of steel and concrete, was a three-tier structure rising 200 feet (60 metres) above the warm waters of the Gulf until four U.S. Destroyers pumped some 1,000 shells into it. The U.S. Defense Department said just 10 pct of one section of the structure remained. U.S. helicopters destroyed three Iranian gunboats after an American helicopter came under fire earlier this month and U.S. forces attacked, seized, and sank an Iranian ship they said had been caught laying mines. But Iran was not deterred, according to U.S. defense officials, who said Iranian forces used Chinese-made Silkworm missiles to hit a U.S.-owned Liberian-flagged ship on Thursday and the Sea Isle City on Friday. Both ships were hit in the territorial waters of Kuwait, a key backer of Iraq in its war with Iran. Henry Schuler, a former U.S. diplomat in the Middle East now with CSIS said Washington had agreed to escort Kuwaiti tankers in order to deter Iranian attacks on shipping. But he said the deterrence policy had failed and the level of violence and threats to shipping had increased as a result of U.S. intervention and Iran's response. The attack on the oil platform was the latest example of a U.S. \"tit-for-tat\" policy that gave Iran the initiative, said Harlan Ullman, an ex-career naval officer now with CSIS. He said with this appraoch America would suffer \"the death of one thousand cuts.\" But for the United States to grab the initiative militarily, it must take warlike steps such as mining Iran's harbors or blockading the mouth of the Gulf through which its shipping must pass, Schuler said. He was among those advocating mining as a means of bringing Iran to the neogtiating table. If vital supplies were cut off, Tehran could not continue the war with Iraq. Ullman said Washington should join Moscow in a diplomatic initiative to end the war and the superpowers should impose an arms embargo against Tehran if it refused to negotiate. He said the United States should also threaten to mine and blockade Iran if it continued fighting and must press Iraq to acknowledge responsibility for starting the war as part of a settlement.

U.S. Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger said Monday that U.S. Warships destroyed the oil platform in the southern Gulf in response to a missile strike on the American-registered Kuwaiti tanker Sea Isle City in Kuwaiti waters on Friday. \"We consider the matter closed,\" he said, a signal the U.S. administration did not want the Gulf crisis to escalate. Iran had warned the United States earlier in the day against exacerbating the Gulf crisis, saying military action would endanger American interests. Following the raid, a okesman for Tehran's War Information Headquarters vowed to avenge the attack with a \"crushing blow.\" \"The United States has entered a swamp from which it can in no way get out safely,\" Tehran Radio quoted him as saying. Diplomats noted, however, Iran was also seeking to avoid ostracism by Arab states due to meet at a summit in Amman on November 8 and discuss the Iran-Iraq war. Iranian Prime Minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi is currently in Damascus, and diplomats said he would seek Syrian help in preventing a total Arab breach with Tehran. Further escalation of the war threatening the Gulf Arab states could work against Tehran at the Amman gathering, they said. \"The ball is in Iran's court now. It's up to Tehran to respond one way or the other,\" a diplomat said. President Ronald Reagan warned Iran of stronger American countermeasures if the military escalation continued. Western diplomats and military sources in the area said shelling the platform appeared to be the least provocative act the United States could have taken once it had decided to retaliate for the tanker attack, blamed by both the Americans and Kuwaitis on Iran. \"It's interesting that they chose something in international waters because it doesn't implicate any other nation,\" one diplomat said. \"This was better for U.S. Relations with the Gulf Arab states, particularly Kuwait.\" Commented another diplomat: \"Kuwait must be happy that the U.S. Has done something, but relieved that Faw was not attacked on its doorstep.\" One source said of the attack on the oil platform: \"They managed to warn off the crew and hit something that was the least nuisance to everybody.\" A diplomat commented: \"They were very clever in the place they chose. It gets attention, but it hasn't devastated anything because it wasn't working in the first place.\" A senior Arab banker in the area said after the news broke: \"This was a good, measured response without risking a flare-up ...

The experts told Reuters Tehran holds the initiative and is likely to control the tempo and direction of the conflict as long as America simply reacts to Iranian attacks by launching limited retaliatory strikes. But if Washington seizes the initiative with bolder steps -- such as mining Iran's harbors, blockading its shipping, or destroying key bases -- it could find itself in a major war. \"Iran is in the driver's seat in an absolute sense as the cycle of attack and retaliation continues,\" said Fred Axelgard, a Gulf War expert with the private Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). \"It's like a Greek tragedy,\" said retired Adm. Eugene Carroll of Washington's private Center for Defense Information (CDI) think tank. Some Middle East experts say the only way out is for Washington to join forces with Moscow in pressing for an end to the war between Iran and Iraq. They say it is not feasible for America to withdraw its 30-ship force from the Gulf area, where the Navy began escorting U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tankers in July. Withdrawal would give the appearance of being chased away by Iran, which President Reagan could never accept. U.S. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger told a Pentagon news conference the destroyers Kidd, Young, Leftwich and Hoel fired about 1,000 rounds of five-inch shells at Iran's Rostam oil rig 120 miles east of Bahrain beginning at about 1400 Gulf time (0700 EDT) on Monday. Weinberger said the platform had been used as a military base by Iran and that the attack responded to an Iranian Silkworm missile strike on the U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tanker Sea Isle City on Friday. Iranians manning the platform were warned in advance and allowed to escape. \"We do not seek further confrontation with Iran, but we will be prepared to meet any escalation of military action by Iran with stronger countermeasures,\" Weinberger said. \"We consider this matter closed,\" he said. Analysts ranging from the liberal CDI to conservatives agreed the U.S. reaction was measured, reasonable and did not escalate the conflict unduly. But they said the question was whether Iran would consider the matter closed.

The drafting of retaliation options follows the failure of high-level talks earlier this month to resolve a case filed by the U.S. National Soybean Processors Association, U.S. officials said. The NSPA charged that Argentina's differential export taxes implicitly subsidize soyproduct exports in competition with the U.S. \"Our only option is some sort of retaliation to restrict (Argentine) access to our market,\" said one U.S. source. The U.S. shelved the NSPA case earlier this year after Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said Argentina agreed to end the differential. But when Argentina announced export taxes for the 1987/88 year in July, the differential was narrowed only one pct.

USDA is projecting the Soviet crop at 210 mln tonnes, but some earlier estimates from Soviet officials were that the 1987 grain crop could match the 1978 record of 237 mln tonnes. Moscow outlined its economic targets for 1988 on Monday, putting the grain harvest goal at 235 mln tonnes. An analyst of Soviet agriculture at USDA noted that a recent article in Izvestia said Soviet grain production in 1988 is planned to be \"25 to 30 mln tonnes more than expected this year.\" \"This indicates that their own estimate is for a 205 to 213 mln tonne (grain) crop,\" the analyst said. In calculating Moscow's crop estimate, USDA used the 235 mln tonne production goal, as well as a 238 mln tonne figure published in a Soviet economic journal this month. USDA's production estimate of 210 mln tonnes reflects a range of 207 to 212 mln tonnes, a USDA source said. Late season rains damaged Soviet crops, slowed harvest progress and lowered Soviet production, analysts said. While in the U.S. earlier this month, Soviet agriculture official Viktor Nikonov predicted that the grain crop would be as good or better than last year's 210 mln tonne harvest. A member of Nikonov's party commented that although 230 mln tonnes of grain were in the fields, harvest problems would bring the final crop down to around 210 mln tonnes.", "labels": ["grain"]}, {"id": "test/21124", "text": "CANADA 750 MLN DLR T-BILL ISSUE YIELD AVERAGE 8.60 PCT - OFFICIAL CANADA 750 MLN DLR T-BILL ISSUE YIELD AVERAGE 8.60 PCT - OFFICIAL", "labels": ["interest"]}, {"id": "test/21128", "text": "FED'S JOHNSON SAYS LOUVRE ACCORD STILL VITAL Federal Reserve Board Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson said the Louvre Accord is still healthy, but said the United States and West Germany must work out differences over their respective roles in fulfilling the accord. \"The Louvre Accord has worked very well in terms of stabilizing exchange rates,\" he said in response to a question during an American Stock Exchange conference here.

December loading rose to 19.65 dlrs, up 45 cents before falling to around 19.05/15 later, unchanged from last Friday. \"Fundamentals are awful,\" said Philip Lambert, analyst with stockbrokers Kleinwort Grieveson, adding that total OPEC production in the first week of October could be above 18.5 mln bpd, little changed from September levels. Peter Nicol, analyst at Chase Manhattan Bank, said OPEC production could be about 18.5-19.0 mln in October. Reuter and International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates put OPEC September production at 18.5 mln bpd. The U.S. Attack was in retaliation of last Friday's hit of a Kuwaiti oil products tanker flying the U.S. Flag, the Sea Isle City. It was struck by a missile, believed to be Iranian, in Kuwaiti waters, and was the first hit on a U.S. Flag commercial vessel in the seven year Iran/Iraq war. The U.S. Owned Liberian flag tanker Sungari was hit in the area on Thursday, also believed struck by an Iranian missile. Refiners were not significant purchasers of physical oil on Monday as a result increased Gulf tension following the U.S. Attack, analysts said. They said a closure of the Strait of Hormuz, through which around eight mln bpd passes, isnlikely because it is not in the interests of the U.S. Or Iran, they said. Any threat to oil supplies would stem from an increase in the number of tanker attacks as part of a widening of Gulf hostilities, analysts said. But they saw the U.S. Strike as a limited reply to Iranian missile attacks, with some describing it as responsible. Geoffrey Pyne, analyst at stockbrokers Phillips and Drew, said he was impressed by the sensible U.S. Response. \"The U.S. Has thought carefully about what would correspond to Iranian agression. They have proved to the Iranians that any further action will be met with a like-for-like response. Today's action by the U.S. Was not escalatory,\" Pyne said. Kleinwort Grieveson's Lambert said the U.S. Strike was \"a responsible retaliation,\" with the U.S. Apparently indicating to Iran that it could increase the severity of its attacksf Iran chose to raise the level of conflict. Chase Manhattan's Nicol took a different view, however. He said he was unable to see what the U.S. Had achieved as Arab states such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, whose interests the U.S. Is supposedly defending, will feel less secure as a result of the U.S. Attack and fear some sort of Iranian retaliation. The initial upward market move this morning reflected a strong speculative reaction to rumours of a U.S. Attack which was thought at one stage to have been against Iranian missile launchers on the Faw Peninsula, close to Kuwait, analysts said. The later downtrend followed confirmation of a U.S. Navy attack on an Iranian oil platform by the U.S. Defence Secretary Caspar Weinburger.

But as the dollar slid against the mark and world stock and bond markets plunged, officials in the major industrial countries played down the dispute as a bilateral problem between the United States and West Germany and insisted that the currency pact was still alive. U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker sparked the market fears when he attacked the rise in West German short-term interest rates. \"That's not in keeping with the spirit of what we agreed to as recently as earlier this month in Washington,\" Baker said in a U.S. Television interview on Sunday. He was referring to the meetings of Finance Ministers from the Group of Seven (G7) leading industrial nations which reaffirmed the pact. Under the Louvre Accord West Germany and Japan, who both have large trade surpluses, pledged to boost their economic growth to take in more exports from the U.S., While the U.S. Agreed to stop talking the dollar down. However, Baker said on Saturday that while the Louvre agreement was still operative, the West German interest rate move would force the U.S. To re-examine the accord. \"The foreign exchange market has been told by Baker that he's going to hammer Germany ... He has just declared all bets are off in terms of currency cooperation,\" Chris Johns, currency analyst at UBS-Phillips and Drew in London said. But a Bank of Japan official took a much more sanguine view, telling Reuters that \"the exchange market is apparently reacting too much, and anyone who sold the dollar on the Baker comment will regret it later on.\" French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur, who hosted the Louvre meeting, was the only one of the G7 Finance Ministers to respond directly to Baker's remarks. He called for \"a faithful and firm adherence by all the major industrial countries to the Louvre accords -- in both their letter and spirit.\" Neither the West German Finance Ministry nor the British Treasury commented on the row. But a Japanese Finance Ministry official said that despite U.S. Frustration over higher interest rates abroad, \"this does not represent its readiness to scrap the basic framework of the Louvre Accord.\" In Frankfurt F. Wilhelm Christians, joint chief executive of West Germany's largest bank, Deutsche Bank, said that following recent meetings with Baker, he believed that the U.S. Was still committed to the accord. In a move which the market interpreted as a possible gesture of reconciliation, the Bundesbank added short-term liquidity to the West German money market at 3.80 pct on Monday, down from the 3.85 pct level at which it injected medium-term liquidity last week.

The new mine, which is being developed at Mahd adh Dhahab in the west of the country and should open in the first half of 1988, would have an annual output of about 3,000 kilos of gold smelted from around 120,000 tons of ore, he said.

The Ipswich factory will remain closed until roads are cleared and supplies of beet build up again. This is the first time in many years that a factory has been closed in mid-campaign, the spokesman added. Other factories are continuing to process beet normally, but harvesting remains very difficult in most areas. Ipswich is one of 13 sugar factories operated by British Sugar. It processes in excess of 500,000 tonnes of beet a year out of an annual beet crop of around eight mln tonnes. Despite the closure of Ipswich and the severe harvesting problems in other factory areas, British Sugar is maintaining its estimate of sugar production this campaign at around 1.2 mln tonnes, white value, against 1.34 mln last year, the spokesman said. British Sugar processes all sugar beet grown in the U.K. The sugar beet processing campaign, which began last month, is expected to run until the end of January. Sugar factories normally work 24 hours a day, seven days a week during the campaign.

Planning chief Nikolai Talyzin told the Supreme Soviet industrial output should rise by 4.5 pct in 1988, up from a planned 4.4 pct in 1987. It rose 3.6 pct in Jan-Sept 1987. Talyzin said national income, the nearest Soviet equivalent to gross national product, should rise by 4.3 pct against a planned 4.1 pct this year. Gross national product measures the output of a country's goods and services. He said the Kremlin planned to produce 235 mln tonnes of grain in 1988 versus a planned 232 mln this year. Moscow produced 210 mln tonnes in 1986. Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev has described machine-builing as a sector whose rapid modernization is essential if the Soviet Union is to compete effectively on world markets. \"Certain difficulties have arisen this year in the machine-building industry. The economy is not receiving a considerable amount of the equipment that it requires,\" said Talyzin, who heads the state planning committee GOSPLAN. Soviet data show the machine-building industry, which makes machine tools, instruments and other engineering goods, increased output by 3.3 pct in the first nine months of 1987 compared with the same period last year. However, this was far below the 7.3 pct increase planned for the industry for the whole of 1988. Talyzin said the ruling Politburo had concluded at a recent meeting that an improvement in economic performance depended to a large extent on conserving resources better. \"Large-scale measures are planned to save resources,\" he said. Finance Minister Boris Gostev told the Supreme Soviet that defense spending in 1988 would total 32 billion dlrs, the same figure as was announced last year. Western governments view official Soviet estimates for defense spending as highly understated, but say the real figure is hard to calculate because Soviet military industries are intertwined with the civilian economy.

Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze abruptly left a parliamentary session earlier on Monday, sparking diplomatic speculation that they were concerned with an urgent matter of foreign affairs. Soviet officials have previously criticized the United States for sending naval forces into the Gulf, saying their presence serves to increase tension. Moscow is officially neutral in the war between Iran and Iraq. It is a major arms supplier to Iraq but has also sought broader contacts with Iran in the last year. Krutikhin said: \"The United States has undertaken an act of armed aggression against Iran, the probability of which has long been spoken of by Washington officials.\"", "labels": ["crude"]}, {"id": "test/21371", "text": "WORLD TELECOMS WATCHDOG RELAXES CAR PHONE RULES The International Telecommunications Union, which regulates communications worldwide, decided at the end of a five-week conference to allow mobile phone systems to be linked with satellites, telecommunications officials said.

In the first nine months of this year, industrial output rose by 3.6 pct. Talyzin said national income, the nearest Soviet equivalent to gross national product, is planned to rise by 4.3 pct against a planned 4.1 pct this year. He said grain production is planned at 235 mln tonnes in 1988, compared with a planned 232 mln this year. The Soviet Union produced 210 mln tonnes of grain in 1986 and the Soviet press has said heavy rain has affected the harvest this year. Talyzin said the 1988 Soviet plan stressed the engineering industry, which Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev has described as a sector where rapid modernisation is essential if the Soviet Union is to compete effectively on world markets. \"Certain difficulties have arisen this year in the machine-building industry. The economy is not receiving a considerable amount of the equipment that it requires,\" said Talyzin, who heads the state planning committee Gosplan.

This is well below the 7.3 pct rise planned for the industry for all of 1988.

Bank of Korea officials would neither confirm nor deny the Yonhap forecast, saying only that the bank would issue its own figures later in the week. Yonhap said the January-September surplus in the current account, which covers trade in goods and services, totalled 7.03 billion dlrs. This already exceeds the seven billion dlr ceiling for the whole of 1987 that the government set in June during talks with the International Monetary Fund aimed at averting a too rapid revaluation of the won against the dollar. The agency said the September surplus was 1.4 billion dlrs, up from 468.1 mln in August and 899 mln a year earlier. \"Exports in October could be relatively modest due to many public holidays, but by the end of this year the surplus will be well over nine billion dollars, close to ten,\" Yonhap said. The sharp rise in the September surplus came from a resumption of export deliveries delayed by strikes the previous month. More than 3,300 companies, including car manufacturers, electronic and electric firms, were hit by labour unrest between July and September. The South Korean government originally targeted a five billion dlr current account surplus this year, but had to raise this to seven billion to reflect a startling first-half export boom. If confirmed, the soaring 1987 current account surplus seemed certain to trigger tougher pressure from the United States which recorded a 7.4 billion dlr trade deficit with Seoul last year, government economists said. The U.S. Government, trying to stem protectionist pressure at home, has called on South Korea to open more markets to American goods and revalue the won faster.

Japan, while diversifying its supply sources of propane and butane for stable supplies, will continue to bank on Saudi Arabian LPG, the sources said. They said Saudi's supply capabilities of LPG, an associate of crude oil, is guaranteed by its crude output capacity. \"Saudi is a reliable supplier in that sense,\" said one trader. Japan imports about 50 pct of its LPG from Saudi Arabia. No single nation could substitute for Saudi Arabia as an LPG supply source to Japan, the sources said. \"Saudi Arabia has committed itself to Japanese LPG buyers, which has quelled fears that LPG supplies from the Mideast Gulf could easily be disrupted in the wake of heightened hostilities in that area,\" said another trader. Saudi Arabia cut LPG shipments to Japan and elsewhere by 20 pct in September after a fire put a major gas plant at Al-Juaimah out of operation. October shipments were back to contractual volumes as Saudi was able to boost exports from other ports. Attacks on Gulf shipping by Iran and Iraq centered on crude rather than products carriers, which has lulled fears of LPG supply disruptions, traders said. They said an Iranian blockade of the Strait of Hormuz was unlikely because it would block Iran's oil shipments. Industry sources said Japan's LPG imports will not greatly rise or fall as its domestic demand growth is estimated at a moderate 2.1 pct a year from 1986 through 1991. Japanese term buyers of Saudi LPG are expected to lift slightly lower volumes from January 1987, when imports from Indonesia are slated to increase, the sources said. The customers are unlikely to slash Saudi term purchases in large scale when Japan increases annual imports of Indonesian LPG to 1.95 mln tonnes in early 1989 from 319,000 tonnes in the year ended March 1987, the sources said. But when demand is sluggish in summer, they will phase down term purchases of Saudi LPG and secure lower-priced cargoes on the spot market, they said. Japan imports some 12 mln tonnes of LPG a year, of which 5.3 mln tonnes are supplied by Saudi Arabia, 3.3 mln under term contracts and two mln through spot purchases. Some 80 pct of Japan's LPG imports are from the Middle East. Saudi Arabia's state owned oil company Petromin has made some concessions on term prices to Japanese customers in the recent round of contract renewal talks, and it is likely the Japanese will accept the offer, the sources said. The Japanese term customers, however, have so far been unsuccessful in establishing a transparent price formula to replace the existing unilateral monthly price notice. Japanese buyers pay Saudi Arabia a price notified by Petromin each month. Most recently the FOB price was set at 87 pct of the 17.52 dlrs per barrel government selling price (GSP) of Arabian Light. Buyers reserve the right to phase down or out liftings should the monthly price be set at over 95 pct of Arabian Light's GSP. Petromin has offered to lower this rate to 90 pct from the 95 pct for contracts with Japanese customers from next January, the trade sources said. Petromin also suggested that a seller's option of supplying up to 20 pct more than the contractural volume be subject to seller-buyer agreement. Under the present contract, Petromin can automatically cut supplies up to 10 pct of the contractual volume. \"If you want to import LPG from Saudi Arabia on a profitable basis, you have to set the price factor at 80 to 85 pct,\" said an official at a major importer. \"Freight costs are higher for cargoes coming from the Gulf than Southeast Asia due to a longer haul and war risk insurance payments.\" Japanese customers will visit Saudi Arabia this month to finalise their separate contract talks, now focusing on contractual period and volume, which could be very similar to current levels, the sources said. \"When we talk business, we would seek profitability and sometimes forget vulnerability of high dependence on a single supplier,\" said one.", "labels": ["propane", "ship"]}, {"id": "test/21488", "text": "INTELLICORP &lt;INAI.O> 1ST QTR SEPT 30 LOSS Shr loss nine cts vs loss 12 cts Net loss 649,000 vs loss 850,000 Revs 5,059,000 vs 4,084,000 Avg shrs 7,041,000 vs 6,900,000 NOTE: Current year net includes charge 152,000 dlrs from amortization of previously capitalized software costs.

Bankers here expressed confidence the two top financial policy-makers would quickly patch up their relationship to steer the economy through a particularly difficult time. \"There are plenty of objective pressures which will result in things getting back to normal again after a period of ill feeling,\" said Commerzbank AG chief economist Juergen Pfister. News on October 9 that the government was planning a 10 pct withholding tax wiped billions of marks off shares and bonds in a market already reeling from rising interest rates at home and abroad. Bankers said the Bundesbank was angered by the way the finance ministry announced the plan -- without consulting the Bundesbank adequately, and allowing apparently conflicting details to dribble out into an unprepared and uncertain market. Both Poehl, 57, and Stoltenberg, 59, have been under extraordinary pressures lately. Poehl has had to switch to the hard line promoted by his deputy, Helmut Schlesinger, jacking up interest rates to fight inflationary fears and abandoning the pragmatic policies he had pursued so far this year to promote currency stability. In recent statements Poehl has sounded more like Schlesinger. For years the softly-spoken economist has been warning in speech after speech that excessive money supply growth would eventually lead to rising prices. Schlesinger now has a majority of support in the Bundesbank council, and since late summer Poehl has had to represent his views, bankers said. \"Poehl is in a minority in his own house,\" said Commerzbank's Pfister. \"Poehl is in a dilemma. He must follow a policy that is not entirely his own,\" said another economist. The dilemma is that if German interest rates rise too far, they will attract funds into the country, pushing up the mark and hurting West German exporters. The dollar has now shed some seven pfennigs since the Bundesbank's new tack became clear in early October. Since last Thursday, United States Treasury Secretary James Baker has criticized the Bundesbank rate increases. Bankers said this could foreshadow a revival of the 1986 war of words between the U.S. And West Germany, in which U.S. Officials talked down the dollar to force West Germany to stimulate its economy and thus suck in more U.S. Exports. One way West Germany agreed to do this was making a round of tax cuts worth 39 billion marks from 1990. But financing these tax cuts has proved more difficult for Stoltenberg than he had bargained for. The cool, unflappable northerner, who was regularly voted most popular government politician last year, had to face resistance from local barons in the government coalition parties and from trade unions to his planned subsidy cuts. The withholding tax was intended to plug one gap by raising 4.3 billion marks. But it has caused an outcry among bankers, who say it will push up borrowing costs. The extra amount this costs the government could wipe out the revenue the tax brings in. Meanwhile Stoltenberg is dealing with a local political row which has turned into the country's worst political scandal. Stoltenberg had to leave monetary talks in Washington last month early to sort out a row in the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein, where he heads the ruling CDU party. The state's CDU premier, Uwe Barschel, had to resign after allegations of a \"dirty tricks\" election campaign led to heavy losses for the CDU in state elections. Barschel was found dead in a hotel bath in Geneva last weekend. Police say the death appears to have been suicide. Cooperation between Poehl and Stoltenberg is all the more remarkable as Poehl is in the opposition Social Democrats, and was appointed by former chancellor Helmut Schmidt. When Poehl's contract came up for renewal earlier this year, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's CDU-led coalition government gave Poehl another eight-year term. Werner Chrobok, managing partner at Bethmann Bank, said he hoped the two men would soon be of one opinion again. But when Poehl criticized Stoltenberg's tax plans he was not only voicing what many bankers felt but demonstrating the Bundesbank's independence of government, Chrobok said.", "labels": ["interest", "money-fx"]}, {"id": "test/21510", "text": "PAPERS SAY VENEZUELAN CENTRAL BANK CHIEF TO RESIGN Venezuelan Central Bank President Hernan Anzola has submitted his resignation and asked President Jaime Lusinchi to transfer him to a post in the oil industry, two leading Venezuelan newspapers reported.

The Bank official said Baker did not mean to talk the dollar down. A lower dollar would harm the U.S. Economy, he noted. A Finance Ministry official who was directly involved in monetary talks with other nations also said the U.S. Would never attempt to lower the reference range for the dollar against the mark or the yen. The market assumes the dollar reference range to be between 140-150 yen and between 1.70 and 1.90 marks. The dollar closed in Tokyo today at 1.7730/35 marks and 141.35 yen. \"Behind Baker's remark was U.S. Frustration over higher interest rates abroad, especially in West Germany, but this does not represent its readiness to scrap the basic framework of the Louvre accord,\" the Finance Ministry official said. He said that on the contrary Baker wanted to avoid any further rise in U.S. Interest rates because it would not only hurt the U.S. Economy but aggravate the Third World debt problem. Higher U.S. Interest rates would merely raise their interest payment burden and depress U.S. Stock and bond markets further, the monetary officials said. Both the ministry and central bank officials, who declined to be named, noted the U.S. No longer wants to see a further decline of the dollar because that could also fan inflationary expectations in the U.S. \"That's why Baker did not fail to add that the Louvre agreement is still operative,\" the senior ministry official said. Baker said in a U.S. Television interview on Sunday that Washington would reexamine the Louvre accord because of West Germany's increase in short-term interest rates. The market at first interpreted this as indicating the U.S. Would be ready to scrap the Louvre accord and let the dollar decline further unless surplus countries, notably West Germany, try harder to stimulate their economies as pledged in the accord, foreign exchange dealers said. But the market on reflection also noted Baker's additional statement that \"the Louvre agreement is still operative,\" and this caused some dollar short-covering in Tokyo today, the dealers said. Uncertainty, however, remained the flavour of the day in Tokyo currency markets. The Japanese monetary officials said Baker's undisguised pressure on West Germany to refrain from guiding interest rates higher may be part of a process of multilateral surveillance, or international economic policy coordination. The G-7, comprising the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada, have agreed to monitor each other's economic policies and from time to time apply \"peer pressure\" to persuade others to change their policies to a desired course, they noted. \"Without such a basic agreement of multilateral surveillance, Baker would never have criticized the West German policy so openly,\" the ministry official said. The U.S.-West German squabble over Bonn's monetary policy should thus be regarded as a process of healthy policy coordination and not as any indication of a possible collapse of the Louvre agreement, the official said. He also said Japan has not received any specific request from the U.S. On its monetary policy, although its short-term money rates have been edging higher. \"This is because we, unlike the Germans, are not taking policy to guide interest rates higher, and the marginal rate rise in recent days is primarily for seasonal reasons,\" he added.", "labels": ["dlr", "dmk", "money-fx", "yen"]}, {"id": "test/21550", "text": "CABLE AND WIRELESS DETAILS MERGER OF H.K.

DOLLAR An income tax surcharge and capital gains tax could bring about an urgently needed depreciation of the N.Z. Dollar, independent economist Len Bayliss said. Bayliss, a former economist with the Reserve Bank and the Bank of New Zealand, said a major depreciation is needed to restore export competitiveness even if inflation is cut by current government policies. The taxes would help cut the budget deficit, which in turn would lower the value of the N.Z. Dollar, he said in a speech. He added that the deficit for the year ending March 1988 could be much higher than the government's 1.3 billion dlr forecast. Since the government was unlikely to cut expenditure as a percentage of gross domestic product, a major tax increase was probably unavoidable, Bayliss said. He would have preferred an increase in the 10 pct value-added goods and services tax, introduced in October 1986, but that would have had a short-term inflationary impact. Import tariffs should be lowered to minimise the inflationary impact of a currency depreciation. The government had failed to bring inflation down despite lower oil prices and an appreciation in the currency, he added. New Zealand's inflation rate was 16.9 pct in the year to end-September against 18.9 pct in the year to end June. The major deficiency in the government's anti-inflation policies was reliance on high interest and exchange rates and insufficient emphasis on reducing the budget deficit, Bayliss said. The government had also failed to reduce overseas debt and debt ratios and cut the balance of payments deficit. \"The widespread belief that (New Zealand's) problems are going to take much longer to solve than was originally thought is soundly based -- primarily because the government's macro-economic policies have been unsuccessful,\" Bayliss said.", "labels": ["money-fx", "nzdlr"]}, {"id": "test/21562", "text": "PHILIPPINE TRADE GAP WIDENS IN JANUARY-AUGUST The Philippines' trade deficit widened to 542 mln dlrs in the eight months to end-August from 159 mln dlrs in the same 1986 period, the National Statistics Office said.

The sanctions were approved by the cabinet soon after Colonel Sitivene Rabuka staged his second coup on September 25. Implementation was postponed in the hope that Rabuka might turn back from declaring a republic. Palmer said the cabinet was happy with the statement from Commonwealth leaders in Vancouver that Fiji's membership of the Commonwealth had lapsed.

A.R. Sendi said on Sunday that Uganda's Ministry of Industry supports his plan to build a factory to roast, grind and pack local coffee for export. Construction will start in December and the factory should be ready by next October. He said the Marketing Ministry has authorised the Coffee Marketing Board to supply his company &lt;Unipack> with 24,000 tonnes of beans a year for processing and export. Sendi also told reporters he had negotiated a 69.7 mln French franc loan from the Banque Industrielle d'Afrique Oriental in Paris. Uganda is the world's fifth largest coffee producer, and expects to produce about 200,000 tonnes this year. Market sources say roasted coffee exports will benefit Uganda's economy as they will not be included in the 2.38 mln (60 kg) bag export quota assigned to the country under the latest International Coffee Agreement. In addition, the value of roasted coffee should be substantially higher than that of unroasted beans, they said.

IRNA, monitored in Nicosia, quoted Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh as saying on his return to Tehran from Moscow that the agreement was part of a protocol on economic cooperation signed during his visit. The amount of crude delivered to the Soviet Union might double to 200,000 bpd later, he said. Aqazadeh said the two sides agreed to conduct feasibility studies for a pipeline to take Iranian crude from fields in southern Iran to the Black Sea through the Soviet Union. Iran is pursuing the pipeline project to protect part of its oil exports from Iraqi air attacks in the Gulf. Irna made no mention of natural gas exports to the Soviet Union, which Aqazadeh had said would be discussed before he left for Moscow. Iran lost most of its refining capacity early in the Gulf war and now imports several hundred thousand bpd of refined products. Aqazadeh said Soviet refined products would be delivered at the Caspian Sea ports of Anzali and Nowshahr, at Neka, near the Caspian, and at Jolfa in north-west Iran.", "labels": ["crude"]}, {"id": "test/21570", "text": "THAI RICE EXPORTS RISE IN WEEK TO OCTOBER 13 Thai rice exports rose to 72,987 tonnes in the week ended October 13 from 54,075 the previous week, the Commerce Ministry said.

If the currency breaks through this level, it may decline sharply,\" said Hirozumi Tanaka, assistant general manager at Dai-ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd's international treasury division. The dollar was at 141.10 yen at midday against Friday closes of 142.35/45 in New York and 141.35 here. The dollar opened at 140.95 yen and fell to a low of 140.40. It was 1.7733/38 marks against 1.7975/85 in New York and 1.8008/13 here on Friday, after an opening 1.7700/10. The currency's decline was due to remarks on Sunday by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker, dealers said. \"The dollar fell over the weekend on increased bearish sentiment after Baker's comments,\" said Dai-ichi's Tanaka. He said this stemmed from mounting concern that cooperation among the group of seven (G-7) industrial nations to implement the Louvre accord to stabilise currencies might be fraying. The dollar's fall was also prompted by a record one-day drop in the Dow Jones industrial average on Friday and weakness in U.S. Bond prices, dealers said. Baker said the Louvre accord was still operative but he strongly criticised West German moves to raise key interest rates. Operators took Baker's comment to indicate impatience with some G-7 members for failing to stick to the Louvre accord due to their fears of increasing inflation. Rises in interest rates aimed at dampening inflationary pressures also slow domestic demand. West Germany and Japan had both pledged at G-7 meetings to boost domestic demand to help narrow the huge U.S. Trade deficit, Tanaka said. U.S. August trade data showed the U.S. Deficit at a still massive 15.68 billion dlrs. But if West Germany raises interest rates, this would run counter to the pledge, he said. \"Operators are now waiting to see if the G-7 nations coordinate dollar buying intervention,\" said Soichi Hirabayashi, deputy general manager of Fuju Bank Ltd's foreign exchange department. The target range set by the Louvre accord is generally considered to be 140.00 to 160.00 yen, dealers said. \"The market is likely to try the 140 yen level in the near future and at that time, if operators see the G-7 nations failing to coordinate intervention, they would see the Louvre accord as abandoned and push the dollar down aggressively,\" Hirabayashi said.

Figures in the Communist Party newspaper Pravda show industrial production rose 3.6 pct in the first nine months of 1987 against 5.2 pct in the same 1986 period. Foreign trade in the same period fell 3.6 pct from the 1986 period as exports fell by 0.5 pct and imports dropped by 4.2 pct. Foreign trade in the nine months totalled 94.2 billion roubles. Separate import and export figures were not given. One factor affecting industrial growth was the introduction of a new quality control plan, Western economists said. Last year's calculations of industrial output included all goods, irrespective of quality. Under the new plan, introduced in line with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's drive to modernise the economy, special inspectors have the right to reject goods they consider below standard. Pravda said 42 mln roubles worth of defective goods were rejected in the nine-month period. The figures also showed that on October 1, there were more than 8,000 cooperative enterprises employing over 80,000 people. More than 200,000 were employed in the private sector, Pravda said, without giving comparative figures. The promotion of the cooperative and private sectors of the economy has been an important part of the modernisation campaign, with measures introduced recently to allow the setting up of small shops on a private basis. Labour productivity rose 3.7 pct in the first nine months against 4.8 pct growth in January to September 1986. But western economists said they treat Soviet productivity figures with caution, as they are more broadly based than in the West, which measures worker output over a given period. Pravda said there were 283.8 mln people in the Soviet Union as of October 1. In the January to September 1987 period 118.5 mln people were employed, a rise of 4.4 pct on the same period last year.
