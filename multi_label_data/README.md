# Multi-label datasets

The folder contains the preprocessed datasets in a JSON format, that were used in our experiments. For information about the original dataset source, preprocessing and JSON format check [multi_label_data_preprocessing](https://github.com/drndr/project_ds_textclass/tree/main/multi_label_data_preprocessing). The preprocessed data for Pubmed and RCV1-V2 is not included, because of file size.

## Folder overview

For every multi-label dataset used in the paper there is a folder containing:
- train_data.json: containing the data used for training
- test_data.json: containing the data used for testing
